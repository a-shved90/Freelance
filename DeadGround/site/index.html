            <p>I went out into the hard light. The mountains hanging over us had a dusting of snow and I knew that it would be cold later. I heft my pack onto one shoulder and walked the long way through the dust to the bases’ living area. This took me past the mortar enclosure, the Javelin station and the main sangar from where we kept watch.</p>
            <p>The sangar was a crude structure of timber, corrugated iron and sandbags perched on the Hesco wall at one side and on rough timber stilts at the other. The Hesco wall itself just a construction of massive gravel filled bags. It was all temporary and makeshift. There were a group of men in full kit on QRF duty lounging about at the foot of the ladder. They called rough greetings to me which I returned with their name, or nickname. The tension seemed to have etched itself a little deeper into their faces. Mostly they turned back to their card games or play-stations, but some followed me with their eyes as I went on.</p>
            <p>At the fifty cal I stood with Spicer and Deaks for a few minutes and looked at the terrain. It hadn’t got any better. There were children playing tag in the dust in front of the mosque and women moving about carrying their burdens.</p>
