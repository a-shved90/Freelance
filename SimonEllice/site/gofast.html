				<h2>Nottambulo</h2>
				<p>Neither the sea, nor those of us who work upon it, know anything of early or late; there is only the right time, or the wrong time.</p>
				<p>Soumaiya brought me strong coffee and ruffled my hair and then pinched me until I pushed her off. I stood under the shower for a bit, working at the cracks in the marble with my toes, and then let her dry me on the balcony with the breeze blowing gently in from the sea. The city was quiet and the buildings were exhaling the heat of the day. The cat came down from the roof and twined herself about my legs. When I had finished getting ready Soumaiya sat on the bed and watched me go. She has a way of looking at me from under her long lashes that is very sad.</p>
				<p>I took an old smock; it can be colder than you expect out at sea, and got into the front of the old Peugeot beside Musty. Martin was in the back, quiet as always.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good evening, boss, how are you today?&rdquo; Musty said.</p>
				<p>Musty talks too much when he is scared. I don&rsquo;t permit this, so Martin and I bear down on him with our silence and he has learned to keep quiet until we are on the way back. Later I will make some casual remark to him, to release him, and he will overflow with words like water bubbling out of a fountain.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You all right, Martin?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ja, boss. I&rsquo;m okay,&rdquo; he said, and his voice sounded okay.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No drink?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No drink.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We went down through the streets of the old town which were only just wide enough for the small car. It was claustrophobic in there, with the constant winding about, and the ancient houses looming above. I had my .38 resting on my thigh, for whatever good that might do, and I&rsquo;m sure Martin did too. We came out onto the sea-front road and sped up. The trunks of the palm trees flashed past rhythmically for a bit and then we slowed to make the turn into the docks. I lifted a hand to the two gendarmes by the gates, leaning on their car smoking. They waved back.</p>
				<p>Tony, Happiness and Pete were there before us with the two white pickups. They smoked and cradled their Kalashnikovs, looking relaxed. Three more pieces of human flotsam, or maybe jetsam, washed up on this alien shore.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Evening, all,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Evening, boss,&rdquo; they said. I didn&rsquo;t hear anything I didn&rsquo;t like in their voices so I turned my attention to the boat.</p>
				<p>Nottambulo, my baby, she looked big and powerful on the oily black water, as she always does in the harbour. She would seem a lot smaller out to sea. We loaded her by heaving the bales hand to hand from the pickups to the boat, my crew catching them and packing them down in the way I like. They are heavy as each one is weighted to sink. We lashed them down under netting and straps. Pete stood slightly to one side keeping a constant watch on the surrounding warehouses and docks, and I had an eye out to seaward. I checked all the things that should be checked: fuel, guns and chocolate, and started one engine.</p>
				<p>I love it when those engines come to life. They burble away quietly to themselves and all the potential that is in them is right there in that deep, quiet sound.</p>
				<p>Tony threw over our painter and I backed us out from the quay. I raised a hand to the three on the dock in goodbye and dismissal, put her into forward gear and spun the wheel. We slid out past the massive stone blocks of the harbour wall on tick-over and then I pushed the throttle a little so that she rose in the water, but still with only a low rumble from the engine. The water in the lagoon was almost completely flat and the entrance to the sea came up very fast as it always does. I held over to the right of the channel so that I could turn into the slight swell that I knew would be waiting for us as we came out.</p>
				<p>I kept her on only one engine until we had turned the headland and then pushed the buttons for two, three and four, eased the levers forward, turned off the riding lights and we became a flat black arrow screaming across a flat black sea, only the passing howl of the engines and the short, white track of our wake marking our way.</p>
				<p>When we had dropped the faint, dark mass of the land astern I turned to put the pole star on the other bow.</p>
				<p>Musty scanned the airwaves with headphones to the radio. Mustapha Ben Berri, he was a kid on the make in Beirut who got caught offering coke near a school by the wrong kind of Muslims and only got away because their van got t-boned at a junction. He ran to the docks, jumped a ship and ended up with us. Lucky really, kids like him are use once and throw away round here, but I like him and he is good in the boat, so he has a place to be for a while.</p>
				<p>Martin had the big glasses and searched the horizon, quarter by quarter with his quiet blue eyes. He speaks slow and not often but he thinks quickly. He&rsquo;s heavy set and strong with it, blond and blue eyed, from Scandinavia somewhere. He hasn&rsquo;t volunteered any personal information so I haven&rsquo;t asked. I trust him though, at least until the fourth beer. The first time I saw him drop a shot of vodka into his glass I didn&rsquo;t know what was coming and got a sprung rib. Since then I keep out of the way and get the local gendarmes to hang about nearby and wait until someone screams. Martin gets a night in the cells, they get to punch and kick a blond, blue eyed European, but not too hard, and of course they get paid. He always seems quite happy, peaceful even, the morning after.</p>
				<p>The wind picked up and a small chop bucked the boat, enough to test the lashings on the cargo, but the screws bit down into the water and we made good time. It was not yet two in the morning, still five hours of darkness ahead, the dead of night.</p>
				<p>At nearly eighty knots we should be the fastest thing on the face of the water and have a radar signature like a rabbit in a field of corn. Only a helicopter would be able to catch us and she&rsquo;d have to find us first; the sea, even the Alboran Sea, which is what the western end of the Mediterranean is called, is a big place.</p>
				<p>I stood with my feet apart, one hand on the binnacle, and the other lightly holding the wheel, feeling the tone of the water and coaxing her into the rhythm of it so that she didn&rsquo;t bounce any more than I could help. It has a sweet, out of time quality, racing this amazing boat through the dark of the moon; I sink into it like a dream and everything is moving very fast and everything is also very still. The miles passed under our keel and I was well into that place, reading the water, reacting without conscious thought, my eyes more on the stars than the compass, a little high on our speed.</p>
				<p>We raised the trawler a bit after three, just where she was supposed to be. First one, rather dim, riding light at the masthead, then the glow from the wheelhouse, and finally her dark bulk against the stars. I eased down to a bare ten knots and circled behind her, keeping our distance. <em>Canaillas</em> was there in rust-streaked lettering on her transom. We were down wind and I could smell the fishiness of her.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ja, boss,&rdquo; Martin said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready too, boss,&rdquo; Musty said.</p>
				<p>On board the trawler a door slammed and someone waved. I put the helm hard over, throttled back and let our momentum carry us closer. Martin and Musty squatted low, ready to reach for the cargo straps. They also had AKs laid ready to hand on the thwarts, set to auto with safetys off, just in case.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ola, Nottambulo,&rdquo; a voice called.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ola, Canaillas,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Is that you Jans?&rdquo; I called.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes, it is me.&rdquo; It sounded like Jans and was about Jans&rsquo;s size and shape.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the tuna?&rdquo; I shouted.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Not bad, caught a few last week,&rdquo; Jans said. Jans doesn&rsquo;t fish for tuna and despises those who do.</p>
				<p>I pushed the throttle leavers full up. The engines roared and the screws thrashed the water into foam, we began to pick up way, but very slowly.</p>
				<p>There was the sharp sound of a single shot and Jans fell forward into the sea. A man stepped out from behind the wheelhouse and began shouting orders in Spanish. Floodlights came on at the masthead, throwing hard white light about. Automatic fire started from near the bow and from the wheelhouse. Martin returned fire at the lights but we hit our own wake coming back at us and his aim went high. Musty was concentrating his fire on the wheelhouse and I heard glass breaking. Someone started screaming and then stopped. I held the wheel and kept us turning. The screws were gripping better now and we were moving away. Some of their fire was hitting the boat.</p>
				<p>It was hard to stay at the helm waiting for the bullets to hit me. I locked my hands onto the wheel to keep me there. Over the engines I heard the dry, splintery sounds of them hitting woodwork and glass-fibre, the sharp whack of them going into the cargo and the crisp and wet sound of them going into muscle and bone. I straightened her up and decided that we must be out of the range of their lights. I jinked her right and then back so that we were no longer on the line that they knew. Their fire was still coming but none of it was hitting us now. I made myself relax my grip on the wheel a bit. There was a smell of blood but no smell of petrol. I spoke to the others but they didn&rsquo;t answer me.</p>
				<p>When we were completely clear of them I backed the engines down to idle, put her in neutral and went to have a look. I knew that Musty was gone as soon as I shone the torch on him. He had slumped back against the bales, more or less upright and facing me. I couldn&rsquo;t see any blood but I could see his eyes; only the dead look at you that way. Martin was lying in the scuppers breathing wetly. I saw where the holes in his smock were and left him be.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;I found the pole star, put it behind us and got back up to speed. Martin died quietly after about an hour; I didn&rsquo;t know when exactly. At one time I could still just see the movement of his laboured breathing, a bit later I couldn&rsquo;t. From that point on he was just a shape in the darkness.</p>
				<p>I drove on with the two dead men for company under the swinging stars. There was no good feeling now and I felt tired and sick as the adrenaline washed out of me. It was hard to remember to check the horizon. I kept looking at Musty, and he kept looking at me. We didn&rsquo;t talk.</p>
				<p>When I had raised the light on the Cap de Trois Fourches, and the darkness around it had thickened so that I could tell it was land, I stopped the boat and turned off the engines. I put them over the side, Martin with the main anchor and Musty with the kedge, tied to their feet. They went off with barely a ripple into the black water, and when they were gone, they were completely and instantly gone, and that was that.</p>
				<p>I sat on the thwart and listened to the silence. There was the slap of the small waves against the side of the boat and the engines ticked occasionally as they started to cool. I took a few deep breaths and shook myself, like a dog shakes, trying to get rid of the tension. When I stopped, my body carried on trembling by itself. I couldn&rsquo;t stop it so I didn&rsquo;t try. The sea was very big and very black. I didn&rsquo;t like that so I stopped thinking about it and ate a piece of chocolate.</p>
				<p>I checked the well and found that we were taking on water. When we were moving the holes would be above the water, when we stopped and settled back down, we began to sink.</p>
				<p>I started the engines, switched on the pumps and turned west of the Cape, away from the entrance to the lagoon, away from home. There are a few small beaches below the cliffs on that side that have no access by land. It was the best I could think of. By the time I let her nose touch the sand of one of them, there was a faint lightening in the western sky, a reflection from the beginning of the sunrise in the east, hidden from me by the land.</p>
				<p>I jumped out with the painter and waded ashore. There was nothing to tie it to and the anchors were no longer available so I wound it round a large stone and jammed that into a fissure in the rocks. The water in the small bay was quite calm so it would be okay. She lay there with her nose on the sand like a big black arrow saying, &lsquo;here it is, this is the place&rsquo;. At least it was dark in there under the cliffs and she would be hard to see against the blackness.</p>
				<p>I worked hard for the next hour or so, getting the cargo ashore. I had to pull her in twice as the weight came out of her and she floated off.&nbsp; It was hard to throw the bales clear of the water but I got most of them ashore without any damage. There was no obvious place to hide them so I packed them behind boulders, and threw a few bits of drift wood and some dried seaweed over them. It wasn&rsquo;t good but it would have to do.</p>
				<p>I pumped out a bit more water, but not much. I was wet up to the shoulders from wading out to get back on board and when I stopped the heavy work, I started to get cold. I remembered that Martin usually brought a thermos of coffee, found it in the scuppers and drank it. It helped a lot. I fetched the painter, scrambled back on board for the last time and backed her out.</p>
				<p>I thought about creeping round under the cliffs but decided that it was too risky. My sleek, black rocket ship looked well enough in the lagoon amongst the other playthings but here in the wild, rugged, empty coast, where only local fishermen go, she looked like a visitor from space. I reluctantly put her nose to sea again and headed out to put the cape, and anyone watching from it, over the horizon. It was galling not to be able to use her full power, but doing eighty knots in the black of night was one thing, in the revealing daylight, another. Apart from that, although I had set out with more than a tonne of fuel in the reinforced tanks, there was not much left now.</p>
				<p>By the time I had looped round and entered the lagoon from the east, the day was past early and into morning. Normally I would go in to the pontoon but the distance out to our mooring would help to hide the damage. The heat from the sun caught up with me as I slowed and I began to sweat. I hooked her up and waved to Asif, who had seen me. He started down towards the pontoon, to come out to me in a tender, but I dove in and swam for it. The cold water broke the spell that had been on me and I began to shake again. I took a hold of myself so that I could talk to him.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ki daayra, boss?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We had a little trouble. They are gone.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Enna lillah wa enna elaihe Rajioun. Is she all right, boss?&rdquo; Asif is the old fellow who looks after Nottambulo for me; he loves her as much as I do.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She needs a clean and a bit of temporary glassing, Asif. I&rsquo;ve left the pump on but she needs to come out.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I will see to it immediately.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need her again tonight, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Inshallah.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I pushed my hands over my head to get rid of the worst of the water, wrang out my shirt and tied it round my waist. I wanted a beer, and then probably another beer. I crossed the road and went under the arch of bougainvillea into the garden bar of the Hotel Rif. I waved to Ali and dropped into a chair under the fronds of a banana. He&rsquo;s a good waiter and he came over quickly with a long, cold beer on a tray. He waited while I poured most of it down and then held the cold glass against my forehead for a moment.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How are you, Simon?&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Better, Ali. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Shall I fetch another one, Simon?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think that&rsquo;s a very good idea.&rdquo; I leant back and closed my eyes. &ldquo;And then a taxi please, Ali.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>When he had gone I took my phone out of its waterproof case and turned it on. Time to share the bad news. Time to phone Guy.</p>

				<h2>Sam</h2>
				<p>I lay face down on the sheets and they became sweaty and wrinkled. It wasn&rsquo;t sleep exactly and it wasn&rsquo;t satisfying, but it was better than nothing. Soumaiya lay beside me for a while and I held onto her. She put a gentle hand on my shoulder at the time I told her to wake me and I pulled myself out of it and stood under the shower for the third time that day. She took her clothes off and came into the shower too so that she could wash me. The water was completely cold by now, or at least as cold as it ever gets here, and that, and more strong coffee helped clear my head a bit. I sat on the balcony, letting water evaporate off me while I drank the coffee. She put a towel over my lap, so that none of the neighbours would be offended, and gently rubbed my hair dry.</p>
				<p>It was time to face the world again, so I put on some clean trousers and a fresh shirt and went out into the hot, dirty streets to get my car. I keep it, an old Lincoln Continental with a bonnet like a pool table, in Azooz the mechanic&rsquo;s yard a couple of blocks away. There was an old Land Rover parked in front of it so I gave a whistle and called out, &ldquo;Hey, Azooz.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Who wants Azooz?&rdquo; a voice called out from under a Hilux.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Simon wants Azooz,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s you, Simon, peace be with you,&rdquo; he said, getting out from under in a hurry. &ldquo;You, you son of a wet fart, get the keys to that piece of shit and move it now, or I will hang you up by your worthless testicles,&rdquo; he said in Arabic to one of the boys hanging about the yard.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Your noble car honours us with its presence. It is like I keep a shark in my swimming pool. No one will ever piss in it while it sleeps here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You have a swimming pool, Azooz?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sadly no, I barely even have a shower,&rdquo; he said. I believed him.</p>
				<p>I took the back way, the way past our emporium of delights. That is to say the nasty concrete building where we store, and from which we sell, the heavy black resin which is our stock in trade. It&rsquo;s in the wasteland of squalor that sits between the old town and the countryside beyond, a place where men sit around doing nothing much and children play in the dirt. The two white Hilux were parked outside and three men were sitting on cheap plastic chairs, playing cards on a cheap plastic table, under a tattered stripy awning; Tony and two locals, Karim and Romeo. They each had a beer and a half smoked cigarette. There were no customers at the moment.</p>
				<p>I got out and said, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; Tony said. &ldquo;Two and a half keys, about.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay. I want you and Happiness and Pete here at nine. You two as well.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I stuck my nose inside to see that all was well. It was, apart from the smell, of course.</p>
				<p>The road up to the house goes between two buildings and seems to just stop against the hillside. It doesn&rsquo;t, it winds left and right across the face of the slope until it gets to the top, but you can&rsquo;t see that from below. There are a few passing places but not many and no clearly defined edge. I kept the old bus away from the edge. There are a couple of crumpled wrecks at the bottom that have had all the useful bits taken off them long ago. There is another road, but it goes the long way round and only the nervous use it. Sometimes I am one of them.</p>
				<p>Once over the shoulder of the hill it all gets a lot nicer; this is where the rich people live. The old town, the harbour and the lagoon are laid out beneath you and look very good. Even the slums don&rsquo;t look so bad and you can&rsquo;t smell them from up here. The road is more or less level and amazingly, has good tarmac on it. The houses are well spread out and have spacious gardens and swimming pools. Guy and Zara&rsquo;s house is the fourth one in, next to the mayor&rsquo;s. They have a good sized staff compound, out of sight behind the tennis courts, and the guard by the gate who waved me in, discreetly lowered his assault rifle as he recognised me, but that&rsquo;s not unusual up there.</p>
				<p>I left the Lincoln in a space under the big canopy where the family&rsquo;s cars sleep while not wanted. It lowered the tone appreciably. I went through the arch of bougainvillea to the pool and the outside bar area. The sun was a huge ball hanging low in the west and the light was soft and had the underwater feeling of evening. The side of the house blazed orange, caught in its last rays, and the shadows of the poolside furniture were long across the terrace.</p>
				<p>They were there, where they usually were at this time of day, on the big comfortable high-backed cane chairs in the leafy, green shade of the vine that grows over the pergola. Guy with his endless, very dilute, scotch and soda and Zara with her much more serious gin and tonic. Guy pretends to drink but Zara does it properly.</p>
				<p>He was sitting with the European papers spread about him. Zara was in a languid pose as usual, leaning forward over the table to display her improbable cleavage. She is thin and her skin hangs a little as if she has dried out within it. She was holding her glass up and looking at me over it. Her nails, which were as real as her breasts, were dark purple.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Missed you again then, darling? How many times is that?&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Leave the boy alone, it&rsquo;s not his fault. Want a beer?&rdquo; Guy said, raising a hand and clicking his fingers. &ldquo;Beer,&rdquo; he said to the young man who ran over from his lurking place near the bar.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And more ice,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The bullets don&rsquo;t seem to like you, do they,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You should see the binnacle,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard. You stayed at the wheel?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I had a choice?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, you saved your own life and the cargo.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Assuming we get it back.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think we will. Anyway, you did what you could, the rest is, as they say, in the lap of the gods.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The boy returned with beer and ice.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;m, my boy, fuck&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Guy said, raising his glass to me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fuck&rsquo;m,&rdquo; I said, raising my glass and taking a swallow.</p>
				<p>I looked at Guy, looking at me with his glittering black eyes, and he looked right back at me. He has the face of Lord Lucan and the eyes of a snake and he wears his hair too long, and dyes it. There&rsquo;s a small black cobra in the mountains here that&rsquo;s pretty similar, though probably nicer.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good old Simon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What would I do without you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Some work, I suppose,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you think the gods look after smugglers?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think the gods look after those who look after themselves,&rdquo; Guy said, &ldquo;And I expect, so does Simon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I do. I don&rsquo;t know why Martin and Musty died and I didn&rsquo;t, but I&rsquo;m grateful it was that way not the other,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Life is precious and beautiful. Well my life is precious, if only she were beautiful,&rdquo; Guy said, laughing.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m beautiful don&rsquo;t you, Simon?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think you two should leave me out of your domestic. I&rsquo;m getting used to people shooting at me, but there are limits to what I can take,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Coward.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Coward, he ain&rsquo;t. I take it that you need some more crew?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Not going to give it up then, darling? Save your lovely skin while you can? Take the money and run?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sweetpea, stop baiting the boy or I will shut you in the pool-house. If it weren&rsquo;t him it would be me. Is that what you want?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, love of my life, that&rsquo;s what exactly what I want.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Excuse her, Simon, she&rsquo;s a little drunk.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are. You&rsquo;re small and you&rsquo;re a drunk.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Very funny. I&rsquo;m not small.&rdquo; She lifted one breast in each hand as if that were the only measure of size that mattered.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I meant mentally, darling,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a bad mood tonight, Zara,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So would you be, darling. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Anyway, crew. Like who?&rdquo; I said, deciding to let that one go.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What about that greasy Genoese? Tony something?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Alleppo. He&rsquo;s handy about boats but he fancies my job.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So take him anyway. What about the munt?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Happy&rsquo;s all right but the sea scares him.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So, it makes him a lot less useful on a boat.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get used to it. Do him good.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll take him tonight and we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Pete?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s basically Tony-lite but without any knowledge of boats.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What am I doing employing such a bunch of fuckwits?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, you hired them.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What about one of the rag-heads?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know them very well. I&rsquo;ll have a look at them and see what I think.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I can get you a line up of ten to choose from if you want.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you want?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I want two men I know and trust who are good at the job,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you do. Just imagine what a shambles this was before you got here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve driven a harder bargain,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Too late now, old son. At least you get to sit at the feet of the master and learn the ways of the tao.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You just said it was a shambles.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yeah, but it was a brilliant shambles. Anyway, you&rsquo;re earning more money every month than your old man earns in a year. So that isn&rsquo;t so bad, is it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, but now I can guess what you&rsquo;re earning, can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s my town. I had to kill a lot of fuckwits to get to this position. And look what I got for it.&rdquo; He pointed at Zara and grinned wickedly.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, darling. Kill the old bastard and have me instead,&rdquo; Zara said. &ldquo;You know you want to. I&rsquo;ll teach you things you can&rsquo;t imagine. Come in the house with me now and I&rsquo;ll give you a taster.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You do know Guy is sitting right there, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you two not realise that I&rsquo;ve led a sheltered life? They don&rsquo;t do this kind of thing in the home counties much,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;I should know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, fuck, here we go,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>I followed her gaze towards the house. A girl in a swimming costume came out of it and walked towards us. We all watched her do it.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is Sam, my daughter. Simon Ellice,&rdquo; Guy said, watching us.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hello, Simon.&rdquo; She pushed her sunglasses up onto her head so that I could see her clear iron-grey eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased to meet you,&rdquo; she said, offering me a hand.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hello, Sam. I&rsquo;m pleased to meet you too,&rdquo; I said, taking it.</p>
				<p>Her hair, still damp from swimming, was thick, and fair, to her shoulders. She was younger than me by a year or two, maybe.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s been telling me about you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t tell me about you. Where&rsquo;ve you been all this time?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, learning to walk about with a pole up my arse.&rdquo; She took her hand back and sat down on the chair beside mine.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She means finishing school, in Switzerland,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;It was bloody expensive and doesn&rsquo;t seem to have done much good.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I can give you a polite brush off in three languages and tell you to fuck off in five, that&rsquo;s got to come in handy.&rdquo; She raised a slim, tanned arm and beckoned to the boy. &ldquo;Would you like another beer, Simon?&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said, feeling I&rsquo;d been offered more than beer.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Watch her, darling,&rdquo; Zara said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not as nice as she looks.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak, Auntie, your dewlap wobbles,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>Zara held her neck with one hand and lifted her glass to her mouth with the other.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you had any children, Guy,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She might not be mine,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I am,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;These things happen along the way sometimes, I&rsquo;m not sure how,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be crude, Daddy. You&rsquo;ve got the most amazing boat apparently, Nott something?&rdquo; she said, turning to me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Nottambulo, it means nighthawk,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Nottambulo.&rdquo; She savoured the word. &ldquo;Dad says you&rsquo;ve taken over all the deliveries and you&rsquo;re practically running the show nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to, it just happened that way,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well you&rsquo;re clearly very good at it and he&rsquo;s very grateful,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He must have forgotten to mention it,&rdquo; I said, looking at Guy.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I do disburse a little small change now and again,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t that generous of you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know, but anything to help out an old pal&rsquo;s boy.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Old pal? You didn&rsquo;t say that. Who?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I? My old mate Teddy. Edmund Ellice. A man of&nbsp; Whitehall corridors and unimpeachable rectitude. Husband of the delightful Helen and, as it happens, Simon&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That rings a bell. Have I met him?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t suppose you will either, sweetheart. We&rsquo;re off his Christmas card list since I took up this line of work.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And almost everyone else&rsquo;s. So, the pater disapproves?&rdquo; she said, turning back to me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t seem to be speaking at the moment,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised. I wonder what I&rsquo;d have to do to stop father speaking to me?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Taking up moral rectitude would do it, I think,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What is moral recti-whatever?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;In Teddy&rsquo;s case, something to do with his bottom I expect,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;Or possibly other peoples,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of a rectal thermometer?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should do that, Sam, whatever it is,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Auntie, I won&rsquo;t. So, can I have a ride in your boat, Simon?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sure, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Great, is it time for me to go and change?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, go do that,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Are you going out for the evening?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. You&rsquo;re going back for that hash and I&rsquo;m coming with you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You said you needed some crew,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;See, I told you,&rdquo; Zara said. &ldquo;Not as nice as she looks.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I may not be nice, but I am a lady,&rdquo; Sam said, and got up. She placed her beer bottle on her head and walked off across the terrace to the house with it balanced there. We all watched her go.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I used to have an arse like that,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Is she really&hellip;&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Supposing&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Just bring her back alive. If she can&rsquo;t look after herself, that&rsquo;s her problem.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We wound on down the hill, the headlights disappearing off into the void one moment and then sliding back onto the cliff face the next. The young woman in the passenger seat looked down at the appalling drop with apparent equanimity. She had changed into dark jeans, a dark top and sturdy boots and tied her hair back. The change made her look businesslike but didn&rsquo;t detract from her loveliness one bit.</p>
				<p>We got to the bottom safely and the road straightened out and we entered the squalor of the slums.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Funny, I don&rsquo;t remember this,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So, how long have you been away?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Nearly two years. A lot seems to have changed.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know finishing school was that long.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I was a slow learner.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you come back in the holidays?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It all seems smaller and dirtier, but I remember the smells.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo; I pulled up outside the storehouse and got out. The Peugeot had joined the two Hilux and the whole gang of them were there, sitting about or leaning on the cars.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Very salubrious,&rdquo; Sam said. We went over to the men. They weren&rsquo;t looking at me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Evening, boys. This is Miss Samantha, she&rsquo;s joining us tonight,&rdquo; I said. They carried on looking at her in ways that were variously curious and predatory. &ldquo;Say hello to Miss Samantha, boys.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hello, Miss Samantha,&rdquo; they chorused, followed by more than one dirty laugh.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Right, Tony, Happiness, you come with us. Romeo and Karim, you stay behind and look after the shop. The rest of you be at the dock at three. Got it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>There were nods and smiles all round.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, come on then.&rdquo; I got back in the car and started her up. Sam got in beside me and the other two got in the back. The springs sagged a bit as Happy sat down.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Samantha. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to have such a beautiful woman with us. My name is Anthony Aleppo, from Genoa, pleased to meet you.&rdquo; He had moved forward into the gap between the front seats and was holding out his hand for her to shake.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Leave it, Tony,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, well, I was only wishing to be friendly.&rdquo; He sat back in his seat, in no way abashed.</p>
				<p>Asif met us at the pontoon, smiling. Nottambulo was tied up near the end.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be okay, Simon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; Sam said, standing by the edge and having a good look at her.</p>
				<p>Asif and I climbed in and he showed me what he had done. It would do fine for now. I patted his shoulder in thanks.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;All ready to go?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;All ready, Simon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I checked anyway.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Come aboard then,&rdquo; I said to the others.</p>
				<p>Tony made to help Sam but she ignored him and jumped gracefully in. She moved about the boat as if she was used to boats.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t swim,&rdquo; Happiness said, looking anxiously at the dark water.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t. Sit down all of you and don&rsquo;t move until I tell you to,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>Asif let us go and I got on with taking her out. When we had settled into a steady twenty knots crossing the lagoon I took a look at my crew. Happy was looking at the bottom of the boat, Tony was looking at the girl, she was looking where we were going. She seemed completely at ease and was letting her body ride comfortably with the movement of the boat. At least she wasn&rsquo;t going to be any trouble in that way.</p>
				<p>I reached into the locker behind me and got out some hardware. I keep four Kalashnikovs on board; they are cheap, easy to get hold of and very reliable. These four belonged to the boat, three for use and one for spare, I clean them myself and they don&rsquo;t leave the boat. I tossed one each to Happiness and Tony.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And me,&rdquo; Sam said, holding out a hand. She looked calm and serious, and as if being passed an AK was quite normal for her.</p>
				<p>What the hell, I threw one gently to her. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a good idea to throw these things unless you are sure they will be caught, but I keep them with the chamber empty so I took the risk. She caught it easily and checked it over as if it was quite familiar to her. I passed out two spare magazines each. I fill them myself too.</p>
				<p>When I opened her up, Happiness&rsquo;s knuckles went as near white as they could go and Sam&rsquo;s face got a big grin on it. She had her chin up and was leaning into our speed, willing us on. Her hair was threatening to come loose from its rubber band but she didn&rsquo;t care. She was a fine sight.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How fast?&rdquo; she shouted back to me.</p>
				<p>I told her.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fucking amazing! Can I drive?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>There was no need for any evasion and no shortage of fuel this time so we went straight there. I found the place without any trouble and, as Asif had replaced the anchors, I dropped the main one off the stern as we went in. We would use it to pull us off if necessary; the additional weight of the cargo would hold us down onto the beach. I sent Happiness over the bow with the kedge. He landed into less than a foot of water and went thankfully back to dry land.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go in and help Happy bring it out. Tony, you catch it and stow it as we throw it up. Sam, you watch our back.&rdquo; I pointed to the narrow opening to the sea. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be long but if anyone had seen us and if they have the legs to reach us in time, this is the point where we&rsquo;re vulnerable.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, skip,&rdquo; she said, grinning at me and settling onto the bench seat at the stern, her AK up and ready.</p>
				<p>It was still there. A lot of flies had settled on it for some reason and they buzzed about in the light of my torch. We shooed them off and began to get it out. It was an awkward spot, too tight for two, so I threw them over the rocks to the big Nigerian who caught them easily and stacked them on the sand. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be nearly as many of them now that there were two of us doing it.</p>
				<p>I thought I heard a sound from the boat as I heaved the last one over. &ldquo;Everything okay?&rdquo; I called out.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; Sam&rsquo;s voice called back.</p>
				<p>We ran them out to the boat, wading in beside her, waist deep, and passing them up.&nbsp; It was about two tonnes, that&rsquo;s a lot of hash, but as a load for two fit young men to move about, it&rsquo;s nothing. It was Sam who received them, not Tony. She took them easily, taking a good hold with both hands and lifting them cleanly. I decided not to ask where Tony was. When we had finished I sent Happy back aboard first and brought the kedge myself.</p>
				<p>The load was neatly stowed and Sam and Happy had almost finished putting the netting over it and tightening the straps. Tony was lying in the bilge unconscious; I assumed he was unconscious not dead. He looked as though he would be missing several teeth whatever happened and the butt of Sam&rsquo;s AK needed cleaning. I didn&rsquo;t really care either way.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sorry about that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>I started her up and made us all stand right aft. One good heave from Happy and we slid off. Time to go home.</p>
				<p>I let Sam drive for a bit on the way back. No one but me and Asif ever drive the boat, but I let her drive anyway. She did it well.</p>
				<p>I considered dropping Tony over the side but decided that he was more useful as he was. Anyway the chandlery would be running out of anchors.</p>
				<p>When we got to the quay the men were waiting for us with the pickups, backed up to the edge ready. Asif had brought my car and was waiting there too. He tied us up and came aboard. He, Happiness and I, threw the bales out to the others and they loaded up. Pete stood by, keeping a good look out. Sam knelt in the bows with her AK out of sight and kept watch too. You didn&rsquo;t have to tell this girl what to do.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Tony?&rdquo; Pete asked. I didn&rsquo;t answer him but carried on working. He shrugged and went back to his job.</p>
				<p>When we had finished I called two of them over and pointed to Tony. &ldquo;Put that in the boot of the Peugeot, and if it wakes up and lives let me know,&rdquo; I said. One of them whistled through his teeth in surprise. Tony didn&rsquo;t stir as they moved him. Happy would tell the others about it and it would do no harm.</p>
				<p>Pete came over to me and said, &ldquo;What happened to Tony? He looks bad. We should get him to hospital.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Whatever happened to him, he brought on himself. Don&rsquo;t bother yourself about it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We need him. He&rsquo;s a good man. I&rsquo;ll take him myself when we&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Why &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
				<p>People generally expect to build up to a fight but I&rsquo;ve learned not to bother with all that. I stepped in while he was still busy expressing himself and hit him hard in the solar plexus. He bent over, holding himself and trying to breathe. Some snot dribbled out of his nose. Now that I had plenty of time I took careful aim at his jaw - I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt my hand, and laid him out backwards.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;One more for the boot, Happy,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, boss,&rdquo; he said, grinning.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, Asif, you can take her now. You know what to do,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I have her, Simon, leave it to me.&rdquo; The old man backed her skilfully out and took her away, back towards her mooring.</p>
				<p>I made the Peugeot lead the way and Sam and I followed in my car. This wasn&rsquo;t strictly necessary, but I&rsquo;d had quite enough of this load and I was going to see it safely back to the store, and then forget about it for a while. The streets were almost empty; this town being a port, never sleeps completely. Two men cruising slowly about in a police car waved at us and I waved back.</p>
				<p>We were quiet in the car, enjoying the moment.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Phew,&rdquo; she breathed out and stretched. &ldquo;That was fun. I love your boat, Simon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. You&rsquo;re turning out to be a bit of a surprise yourself.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Amazingly, I&rsquo;m really glad to be back. I thought it would be boring, being here again, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be. Maybe this isn&rsquo;t such a bad life after all.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was so good last night, but maybe I do now. Did you grow up here?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;In the holidays. I&rsquo;ve mainly been at schools in the UK, Dad&rsquo;s not big on parenting. I thought I&rsquo;d be here for a few weeks and then go travelling or something, but now I think I might stay for a while.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. So, they did a course on the common assault rifles of the world in Switzerland?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Dad. He&rsquo;s always been very good about letting me play with his toys. We used to go out and practise together since I could lift a .22. I think it&rsquo;s his idea of being a good father.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Now you say it, I don&rsquo;t know why I asked.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a flat in town?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Is it nice?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We sat on the bonnet of the Lincoln while they put it all away. No need to take a turn now. When it was all done we got back in and I swung the old car around.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Shall I take you home, Miss Wealden?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Only if you want to,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>We left the car at Azooz&rsquo;s and walked through the empty streets. Under one of the arched passages I drew her to me and we kissed, experimentally at first and then harder. We pulled ourselves apart and went on, not talking but very aware of each other.</p>
				<p>I held the door for her, shut it behind us and kicked off my shoes in the hall. She unlaced her boots and then prowled quickly about, looking at the flat. I waited in the big front room that looks out over the city. She came in and stood in front of me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Nice,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Glad you approve.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She stepped into me and I held her hard against me and we kissed some more. Although slim, she was strong. Almost at once it was urgently necessary that we undress so we separated just long enough to rip our clothes off and then sank onto the soft rug together.</p>
				<p>Later, when our skins were cooling in the slight breeze from the open doors onto the balcony, I picked her up and carried her to the comfort of the big bed. We began again there, more slowly this time, and, liberated from the first overwhelming need, worked ourselves up to such a height that afterwards we lay exhausted in a slippery pool of our shared sweat, dazed, and in my case, panting slightly.</p>
				<p>We moved apart so that we could cool down and sleep. I let myself dive down into the deep, soft, blue water of sleep with the same abandon with which I had just given myself to the girl beside me, and some of the stored tension within me washed away.</p>

				<h2>Fishing</h2>
				<p>In the morning, not early, I woke and sat up, carefully so that I wouldn&rsquo;t disturb her. She was as beautiful in sleep as in waking. I leant back against the carved wooden headboard and looked at my familiar bedroom. There were motes of dust dancing in the golden shaft of light streaming through the open doorway and I watched them for a while.</p>
				<p>Sensing my wakefulness or waking of her own accord she stretched, yawned and sat up. She went from sleep to waking easily and immediately and was completely present.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Morning. That was a good sleep. Got any coffee?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Should have.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Half way to the door I remembered Soumaiya. I took a light dressing gown from the back of the door and put it on.</p>
				<p>She was in the kitchen wearing a long dress and a headscarf instead of her usual jeans and t-shirt. She kept her eyes down and wouldn&rsquo;t look at me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I will bring you coffee,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I can take it,&rdquo; I said. There was a tray with two cups on it, waiting.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I will bring it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No, I will bring it. It is my job,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>I went back to the bedroom and sat on the bed. Sam was sitting up with the sheet pulled up to her lap and one of my books on the history of the Rif open on her legs.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I want to go up into the hills,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Has Dad still got the farm and the horses?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Soumaiya brought the coffee in and put it on the table on my side of the bed. She kept her eyes down and withdrew.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Your house girl?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes. Came with the flat,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Soumaiya.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She drank the coffee and she read bits of the book. I sat beside her on the bed and drank coffee and thought about things, mainly her.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is quite interesting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny how sometimes you don&rsquo;t notice really cool things that were there all along.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You mean the Rif mountain range. Home of the Berbers and source of the black gold?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The word Berber is from the same root as barbarian. They&rsquo;re originally a Nordic race that got stranded here by the tides of history. Our local Vikings,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So it says. I want to go there now.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Have you not been?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No. Apart from teaching me to shoot, Dad wouldn&rsquo;t let me do much that was interesting. No trips into the interior. Said he&rsquo;d be too tempted to sell me. I don&rsquo;t think he ever completely trusted his men either.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;d command quite a reasonable price.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think I could get about quarter of a tonne for you. Possibly with the baggage animals thrown in. Would be more, of course, if you were a virgin.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am a virgin.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Put that book down and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, will you?&rdquo; She put the book down.</p>
				<p>I showed her, but I shut the door first this time.</p>
				<p>Afterwards we stood in the shower and had a wash and then had breakfast on the balcony. She wore my dressing gown and received Soumaiya&rsquo;s service as her natural due. It occurred to me that my small collection of side arms and other toys were lying oiled and ready in the drawers in my study.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What about you then, Simon Ellice? Tell me everything about yourself, immediately.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Everything?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay. My name is Simon Ellice but most people call me Si. I am the only son of Edmund and Helen Ellice of Aldermark in Hampshire. I&rsquo;m currently earning my living running hash from Morocco to Europe for your father.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You mean generally or specifically?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Both.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good question. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about that myself. I was bored; at least, that was part of it anyway. I&rsquo;d done a year of ocean racing and had had enough of it. I was home and I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with myself and then Dad and I had a fight.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You killed him?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I mean a row. Just words.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Of course. Why? What about?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Me. I was supposed to get a job. A proper job. Like him. Something involving suits and desks and living in London.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fuck. At least I don&rsquo;t have that problem with Dad.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No. I thought I wanted to do something more with boats. He told me if I did I would always be poor and he wouldn&rsquo;t support me. It got my back up a bit and we had words.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You decided to prove him wrong?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew about go-fast boats, or cigarette boats, that&rsquo;s what they call them in the States, and I saw an article about them one day and thought I could do better. So I did. I have. I borrowed some money from one of my father&rsquo;s off-shore accounts and had her built to my design in Italy. I&rsquo;ve given the money back since but we&rsquo;re not speaking.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sound like you mind too much.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We never really got on. Not that I ever saw much of him, what with being away at school and him always working.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to imagine them being friends.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;My father and yours?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;They were pretty close at one time. University and afterwards. And Mum as well. I&rsquo;ve seen the photos.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why here.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Rather than any of the other dealers along this coast? Yes, family connections.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite cool. I feel like we almost know each other.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If Guy hadn&rsquo;t gone beyond the pale I expect we would&rsquo;ve.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And now here you are, out of bounds yourself.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Only temporarily I hope. I want to be able to return to the real world sometime. I&rsquo;ve no reason to think that anyone back home knows what I do for a living but I&rsquo;ll spend a bit of time somewhere else doing something safe and innocent before I go back. In the meantime I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s driving Dad mad.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What about your mother?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t care what I do. We keep in touch by phone. She keeps talking about visiting but she hasn&rsquo;t so far. I&rsquo;m not sure she should, but she&rsquo;ll do whatever she wants as always, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she visit?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Dad would go mental for one thing. There&rsquo;s a lot of history between them. Her and Guy and Ed. I don&rsquo;t know what Guy did but it must&rsquo;ve been something big.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;More than likely. Would it matter if he did? Your dad. Go mental, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Guy&rsquo;s right when he said rectitude; he really cares about the forms of things. But for all that, I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t even know what he does. Not really. But I&rsquo;m pretty sure he&rsquo;s not just a civil servant. Sometimes he seems to know things you wouldn&rsquo;t think he would know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;When I said why I left The Rifles he looked at me like he knew what I wasn&rsquo;t saying.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I thought you must&rsquo;ve been in the army. Dad wouldn&rsquo;t let me. Was it good?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sandhurst was okay but and I didn&rsquo;t get on with regular army life.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Got bored and got into trouble?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;In essence, yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Happens to me all the time.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, your turn,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Tell me about you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Do you have a mother?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;ve asked Dad but he doesn&rsquo;t always tell the same story.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you mind much?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;About not having a mother or Dad lying to me?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Both, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I mind not having a mother. I&rsquo;ve never had one so I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve missed. I never think about it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And Guy lying to you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he really lies as such. It&rsquo;s more that truth as a concept is something that passed him by. He doesn&rsquo;t mean anything by it, it&rsquo;s just the way he is. Some people are just like that.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. I suppose there&rsquo;ve been a few Zaras over the years?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;One or two.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;None who mattered?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;To me? Fuck no. They come, they go.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Guy gets bored of them?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sometimes. This one seems to be unusually persistent.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;They do seem to have a sick sort of synchronicity about them, don&rsquo;t they, Guy and Zara.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So, it was just you and Guy then? Living up there on the hill. Your childhood.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Apart from a few schools.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And uni?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sort of.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Got bored&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;&hellip;and got kicked out. Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Could happen to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I looked into her eyes and she looked into mine and I smiled and she smiled back and the whole damn world that didn&rsquo;t understand us could go hang.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t always like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The money and the lifestyle, I mean. We&rsquo;ve sat down at night with our backs against a wall and no chance of sleep a few times, Me and Dad.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I can imagine,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It was a brutal thing, getting the town. And then it was keeping it and that&rsquo;s not much easier.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Nor likely to ever be so.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No but I&rsquo;ve never seen him looking so relaxed as now. I think it&rsquo;s because of you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen him look anything else.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t know him. I think he trusts you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard to believe.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;m probably imagining it. How long do you plan to stay?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t really know. Not long. I&rsquo;ll earn a bit more cash and see how I feel. I hope I&rsquo;ll have the sense to get out before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Before they find out back home?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No, before someone kills me.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Is that likely?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting more likely. When I built Nottambulo I did too good a job in a way. I&rsquo;ve made something that just can&rsquo;t be beat. Your dad owns the S&ucirc;ret&eacute; and the Gendarmerie in Nador so we&rsquo;re pretty safe loading up, and once we&rsquo;re at sea no one can catch us. Unlike the other methods we haven&rsquo;t lost a load yet,&rdquo; I touched the table to ward off bad luck.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Only just.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Only just. Word has got about.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What are the other firms doing?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Same as always: hiding it in containers, small fishing vessels, yachts, people whatever.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And now they all want a go-fast boat instead?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;They do. And why buy one, if you can, which you can&rsquo;t easily, when you can steal one, if you can. She&rsquo;s guarded round the clock and I&rsquo;m very careful what dark alleys I walk into. It can&rsquo;t go on like this forever.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I see that. Where&rsquo;ll you go, when you go?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, Greece probably. I could slip back to the yard in Italy, have the old girl re-sprayed and the cargo bay turned into accommodation, and then head off to the islands for a bit of relaxation.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That sounds like fun. When the time comes, I might ask for a ride.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Who knows, when the time comes, I might offer you one.&rdquo; We clinked coffee cups on the idea. I wondered if Soumaiya could hear us from the kitchen.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If I ever meet your father I&rsquo;m going to thank him for pissing you off,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I might just do the same,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan for the day then?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know what my plan is but I&rsquo;m not sure where you fit into it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I just sign on as crew?</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Did you? I got distracted.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I did. I intend to come with you and do what you do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And if you get in the way, or get hurt or killed?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Then I do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;As long as we understand each other.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay then. Get dressed and choose something from the top drawer of the cabinet in the study. We&rsquo;ll leave in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We walked through the hot, dirty, busy streets to get the car. Sam only had the clothes that she had had from the night before and I could see that she was hot in them, but they hid the slim .32 hammerless that she had chosen well enough.</p>
				<p>She looked about at the scene and the people with interest. &ldquo;They used to come up to me and try to sell me things,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Not while you&rsquo;re with me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is Azooz. Hey, Azooz, how are you today? This is Miss Samantha. She&rsquo;s allowed to use my car, okay.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Azooz exchanged a few remarks with me sotto voce and then he went up to Sam, gently took her hand and said, &ldquo;Greetings, Miss Samantha, my life is complete now that I have met you, I and all my slaves wait to serve you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Azooz, that&rsquo;s good to know,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You can drive. Might as well get used to it,&rdquo; I said, and got into the old bus.</p>
				<p>When we had pulled out of the yard - she got the hang of the car quickly enough - she said, &ldquo;What were you two talking about back there?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He said if I got bored of you he would like to buy you. I said you owned me not the other way round. He said I&rsquo;d been out in the sun too long again. I said you were Guy&rsquo;s daughter and then he understood.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So I own you? I haven&rsquo;t owned anyone before.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t believe.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Why do you keep your car there, not outside your flat?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;They watch it twenty four hours a day and make sure no one puts anything underneath it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s interesting. Where&rsquo;re we going by the way?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Back to the store. Turn right at the water.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I made a call on my mobile and Hamza arrived on his little moped as we pulled up outside the low concrete building. Karim was dealing to a small queue at the plastic table and Happy was sitting by the door cradling a mug of sweet tea and keeping watch from behind mirrored shades. His personal AK was leaning against the wall beside him. A big CCTV camera bolted to the corner of the roof sent grainy images to a monitor above the massive old safe inside.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Go and help Karim,&rdquo; I said to Sam. &ldquo;Karim, explain what you&rsquo;re doing will you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Over here, Hamy. Pull up a chair.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Hamza and I sat under the old acacia, to one side. He was in his early twenties, thin as a reed and as sharp as the teeth of a barracuda. He might look poor but that was just part of his trade.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Simon. How may I assist you today?&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I commiserate you on the loss of Mr Martin. Mustapha not so much. I can get you another Mustapha tomorrow if you want.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know, Hamy. I&rsquo;m okay for the moment. Do you know who I need to find?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I regret, I do not. I could ask around for you if you would like. How badly would you like to know?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Quite badly. Half a kilo maybe.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>As well as being a man who could find things out Hamza had a few girls who sold to tourists straight off the boats.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So little for the life of two of your best men?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We bargained back and forth for a bit, mainly out of habit and politeness and then shook hands on it.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. I will text you as soon as I can. It may be a few days.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Tonight would be better.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You have no patience, Simon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Hamza got back on his bike and put-putted away. I went over to see how Sam was getting on. They had nearly got through the queue of small time dealers who came each morning to get what they would sell to the tourists.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe how cheap we&rsquo;re selling this stuff. This is thousands of pounds worth in Basle.&rdquo; She held up a block of kif wrapped in cling film.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How would you know that then?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I take an interest in the family business.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you? You wait till you see what the producers get for that. I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ve paid more for a coffee. Good morning, Mr Alwas. How are you today? This is Miss Samantha who has joined our team.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How lovely to meet you, Mr Alwas. Can I get anything for you?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>I could see the man visibly stick out his chest and pull his stomach in. It didn&rsquo;t make much difference.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Mr Alwas is an important businessman from Imzouren and he always honours us with a substantial purchase. Will I have them bring you a whole block from our meagre stores?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. Oh, why not. Thank you, that would be very kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Karim.&rdquo; I snapped my fingers and Karim went quickly to fetch a kilo block from the pile on the table inside.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse us, Mr Alwas, I must take Miss Samantha to see Mr Guy now.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. Do please give my kindest regards to Mr Guy.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He will be very happy to receive them.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We got back in the car. It was hot now so I turned the aircon on. I decided to drive this time.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Surely this is the wrong way,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Force of habit. I don&rsquo;t tell anyone where I&rsquo;m going. We&rsquo;re off to the boat yard. I have to see my baby and make sure we can have her back for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The yard was busy from the increasing arrival of pleasure craft into the lagoon but they always had a space for us. Nottambulo was up on a cradle by herself in a shed to one side. Asif was with her, as I knew he would be. She looked huge out of the water.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hi, Asif, how&rsquo;s it going?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Simon. Come see. I show you.&rdquo; He led us forward to where two lean young men, stripped to the waist and covered in dust, where sanding off his temporary glass-fibre repair to one of the bullet holes in the hull, one of them holding an air sander and the other sucking away the dust with a vacuum hose.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Come and look at this,&rdquo; I said to Sam.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s steel,&rdquo; she said, having a close look.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Stainless steel. Tougher than glass-fibre and lighter for its strength too. They&rsquo;ll have welded that up, ground it flat and got two coats of radar absorbing paint on it by this evening. Won&rsquo;t they, Asif?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I will be watching them while they do. The work will not pause for a second.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Why the funny shape?&rdquo; Sam said, running her hand over a section of the hull.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Those grooves entrain air under the keel. At speed we move along on a cushion of bubbles,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Entrain, eh?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a boat geek.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am a boat geek.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We walked on to where another team were working on another hole and then climbed a ladder to inspect the topside. Here more men were cleaning back the glass-fibre topcoat around holes in the binnacle and in the covers over the fuel tanks and the engine housings.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;These will be filled with resin, glassed over and sanded back tonight too. See the fuel tanks? More stainless with a jacket of Kevlar and then glass-fibre on top.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You were at the wheel when this happened?&rdquo; Sam said, inspecting the damage to the binnacle.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Bloody hell, you were lucky.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes. Have a look at these.&rdquo; Asif and I lifted one of the engine cowlings. &ldquo;These are four V8 Mercurys, two pairs linked in series, each pair driving through one shaft. There&rsquo;s a clutch between each pair so that I can start them independently and those are super-cavitating props back there.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say.&rdquo; She bent down over the nearest one and stroked its gleaming inlet manifold. Asif looked scandalised. &ldquo;Now can we get out of here? I&rsquo;m dying of heat in these clothes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay. Time we went to see the old man. Asif, I&rsquo;ll meet you at the pontoon at ten. Have her fuelled and ready. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No problem, Simon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We got back in the car, got going and I put the aircon on full. The temperature had gone up ten degrees in the last hour and the sunlight had got the hazy quality it gets when it&rsquo;s going to be hot.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; I said. Sam was in the process of pulling her top over her head. &ldquo;Drugs, guns, slaves we can do. Murder, torture, no problem. Naked female flesh in public we can&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Seriously. Wait till we get to the house.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How about this?&rdquo; She wriggled out of her jeans instead. &ldquo;Mind that truck.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Where the fuck did you come from?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Somewhere cooler than this, that&rsquo;s for sure.&rdquo; She put her head in the blast from the aircon and pulled down the neck of her top so that the air went down it. I concentrated on the road and put my foot down.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is nice,&rdquo; she said. She was playing with the Colt Pocket Hammerless that she had chosen. &ldquo;Ah, ha. That&rsquo;s what I want.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She put down the window a couple of inches and before I had realised what she was up to, took a shot at a passing road sign.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Got it!&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If you do that again, you&rsquo;re going to have to walk.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Live a little, can&rsquo;t you.&rdquo; She replaced the round in the magazine from some loose ones that she had in a pocket of her jeans and leant back against the seat. She stayed quiet until we got there, occasionally drumming on the dashboard to express her happiness. This suited me; I had things to think about too.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hello darlings. What&rsquo;s he like then, sweetie, any good?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>She and Guy were having breakfast on the terrace at the table under the pergola. There was a bottle of gin in an ice bucket next to her.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Morning, Auntie. Didn&rsquo;t you sleep well? You look a little haggard,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Shut up you two,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;Boy. More coffee.&rdquo; He raised his voice to a young man who was standing sweating in the sun by the house. &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo; The man stopped in his tracks. Guy turned to me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Bacon, scrambled, toast, coffee,&rdquo; I said, loud enough for the man to hear me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Same for me,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to change.&rdquo; She walked into the house and we three watched her go, as we had before.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well what?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How did you get on? The hash. You know; what we do for a living.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. Got it all back. The boat&rsquo;ll be ready for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. How did my daughter do?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Tony tried it on and she hit him in the head with the butt of an AK. More than once. He&rsquo;ll live.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. She&rsquo;s useful then?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, very. She says she&rsquo;s signed on as crew. Has she?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why not. How was the munt?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Better than I expected.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s sorted then.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Sam came back out of the house in a bikini. She dove into the pool, swam its length and back again with an easy crawl and pulled herself out at the end. She got to her feet, put her head back and used her two hands to sweep the water out of her hair.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Shame they&rsquo;re starting to sag already,&rdquo; Zara said. They weren&rsquo;t though. Not at all.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; Sam said, taking a chair. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plan then?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You and I have a little job to do and then this evening we&rsquo;re off for a boat ride,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;You coming too?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just decided I am.&rdquo; The old bastard was smiling again.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, goody,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;In which case I think I&rsquo;ll have a siesta after breakfast. I&rsquo;m quite shagged out.&rdquo; She looked at Zara over her coffee cup, daring her to say something.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>When I got back to my flat Soumaiya was making bread in the kitchen. She was still wearing all those clothes. She is slim and quiet and has the gentle eyes of a gazelle. She turned to me and stood there waiting, with her eyes down, for me to say what I wanted.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hi, Soumy, how&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It does not matter how I am doing.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It does to me.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What would you like me to do for you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am here to meet your needs. Whatever you say I will do. I can cook you some lunch if you would like. Tell me what you want.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, Soumaiya, I&rsquo;d like some lunch please.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I will make you some lunch.&rdquo; She turned her back to me and started working.</p>
				<p>I went into the front room and lay on the couch. The cat dropped onto the balcony and came in. She jumped up onto my belly and started kneading it with her paws. I took her by the scruff of the neck and shook her gently and then stroked her hard. She lay down and started purring and washing herself. I let my head go back and watched the slowly turning blades of the fan.</p>
				<p>Soumaiya put a tray with some couscous and tagine down on the table near me and gave a little cough. It was dark outside and the cat had gone.</p>
				<p>When I had woken up enough to realise that I was hungry, I ate. It was very good and I finished it all and wiped the plate with some bread. She took that tray away and bought another with coffee. I drank it and went into the shower for a bit. She didn&rsquo;t come to wash me, so I had to wash myself.</p>
				<p>When I got out of the shower she brought me fresh clothes and stood waiting. &ldquo;Soumaiya,&rdquo; I said softly, but she kept her eyes down and wouldn&rsquo;t look at me. I picked up my favourite .38 and a spare magazine from the drawer and set out for the night&rsquo;s work.</p>
				<p>It seemed like everyone on the street scuttled away from me as I walked. They all kept their heads down and turned aside. I wanted to tell Azooz to get me a different car but he wasn&rsquo;t in the yard so I looked at one of his boys. The boy raised his eyes to the office with the greasy bed in it over the workshop and unconsciously put his hand over his bottom.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; I said, and got into the Lincoln. There was the empty shell casing from Sam&rsquo;s .32 on the floor. I threw it out of the window and the boy caught it.</p>
				<p>Asif was sitting on a chair at the landward end of the pontoon when I got there and Nottambulo gleamed blackly at the other end of it.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;All ready, boss.&rdquo; He got off the chair for me but I didn&rsquo;t want it so he stood there. I walked up the pontoon and back again. Every now and again a car cruised along the boulevard, mainly taxis hoping for a fare, the sound of their tyres on the tarmac loud in the still air. The lights from the garden of the Hotel Rif shone up into the tall palms planted at regular intervals along the front. It was still warm from the heat of the day and I quite fancied a cold beer but now was not the time.</p>
				<p>Happiness arrived in a Hilux and showed us his very white teeth in his very black face. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this business with boats,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You want to quit?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just saying,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He and Asif exchanged a look. I walked up the pontoon and back again. And then again.</p>
				<p>My phone rang. It was Hamy. &ldquo;The man I think you want is Arkiba,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Arkiba is a place not a man,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, Arkiba. Mochadem Djout of Arkiba, or rather one of his sons.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You sure?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Did I ever let you down?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Not yet. Thanks Hamy.&rdquo; I hung up.</p>
				<p>Guy&rsquo;s white Range Rover arrived at speed and stopped in the space that&rsquo;s usually kept clear in front of the entrance to the pontoon. Sam got out of the driver&rsquo;s side. She was in working clothes again, a dark shirt, jeans and the same heavy boots. She looked as good in them as she had before.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Evening, captain. Crew reporting for duty, sir,&rdquo; she said, offering me a smart salute and a radiant smile.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Think you can find room for an old man?&rdquo; Guy said, joining us. He looked damn happy too, and not that old.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Come on then,&rdquo; I said, and led the way. Sam skipped up beside me and took my arm in hers.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you pleased to see me?&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Of course I am, but we&rsquo;re working now. Come on, Happy.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;re we doing for rope?&rdquo; Guy asked.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Plenty in the stern locker.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Heavy things?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Weights. You know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Bugger. No.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Unlike you to forget something, Simon. Happiness, perhaps you and Asif could find something?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Right away, boss.&rdquo; He made the planks shake as he ran.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten how big this thing is. I&rsquo;m glad we didn&rsquo;t have to get another one. Perhaps you would like to show Sam how she works?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes please,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>We climbed aboard and Guy sat on the big bench seat at the back and watched as I talked Sam through checking the tanks, opening the fuel lines and starting number one engine. She was about to push the button for number three when I grabbed her hand.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No. Only one for now.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;One is enough to take us out.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;But two would be more fun.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You can have fun some other time. Right now, one engine will do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Children, children. Sam, this is work not play so do as you&rsquo;re told.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father.&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t seem put out.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good now where&rsquo;s that munt? I want to get on with this.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The big man ran back down the pontoon with a holdall swinging from one hand. I nearly dropped it when he swung it over the side to me. I heaved it into the scuppers and let it lie.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;All right then. Happy, you get in and sit down. Sam you get the painter in and then get those fenders aboard,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, boss,&rdquo; they said, and did as they were told. I eased her out backwards and then put her into forward gear and off we went.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You can take her,&rdquo; I said to Sam. &ldquo;No more than twenty knots inside the lagoon. Keep to the right of the channel and turn into the breakers on the bar. If you make Happiness crap himself you can clean up the mess. If you break her you will walk home.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye captain.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I went back and sat next to Guy.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You got a grip of your crew, old son?&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cope,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Got to run a tight ship you know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fuck off.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Whatever you say, old thing.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You do realise that she might get killed doing this?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So might we all, so might we all. Let her have her fun. Might as well get some work out of her. Recoup some of the expenses.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Your call I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It in&rsquo;t her that usually has the problem in my experience. We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; I shouted over the howl of the engines, &ldquo;Take her up to eighty, no more. Course, due north for now.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She raised a thumb in acknowledgement.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The radio or the binoculars?&rdquo; I said to Guy.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he do it? he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Take a look.&rdquo; I pointed to the figure sitting down in the bottom of the boat holding onto the cargo straps for dear life.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Airwaves then,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>I passed him the headphones. He tied his long hair, which was flying about in the wind of our speed, in a rubber band and put them on, plugged them into the set which was beside him and began to turn the dial. I took the heavy binoculars from their place in the binnacle locker, braced my feet against the planks on the floor and let my upper body move with the boat. It was hard work keeping them steady but it got easier after a while.</p>
				<p>We saw, or heard, a few fishing vessels, a couple of small oil tankers coming up from the canal, and a fine twenty five metre ketch inbound, but nothing we cared about. I gave Sam a new course after about an hour and a bare three hours after we had set out we were creeping up on the wrong side of the harbour breakwater at Adra on the Spanish coast.</p>
				<p>The lights from the dock threw a black shadow on the water and I got onto the rocks by feel as much as by sight. I put the line round a rock and pulled her in hard, squeezing the fender. Happy left some skin on the rocks and sucked his hand but Guy jumped ashore nimbly enough. I threw the rope back aboard and Sam backed her out into the darkness.</p>
				<p>We walked out from behind a warehouse into the orange light from the lampposts and headed into the town, just three guys off a ship going for drink. We chose a shabby bar in a side street. I had a strega with the others while the barman fetched us an unlicensed taxi. I made the driver drop us off a few streets from Jan&rsquo;s house and we walked the rest of the way.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You going to keep watch then, Happy?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sure, boss,&rdquo; he said, and faded into the darkness.</p>
				<p>I knocked on the door. It was late for house calls, even for Spain, but Camilla was up.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ola, Camilla.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ola, Simon. Ola, Mr Guy. I thought you would come. Come in. Come in. You can leave us, Belinda.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>A big, comfortable woman all in black got herself out of a chair with some difficulty, nodded to us and left. Camilla, Guy and I sat at the kitchen table and she poured brandy for us.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Jans.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Jans.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Jans.&rdquo; We clinked glasses.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Camilla,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry too,&rdquo; she said, looking at her glass.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you know who?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ah, Jans. He always made light of it but we both knew this could happen. I have two sons without a father now. They want to work the boat. Teordoro is only fifteen. It is not easy growing up these days.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Jans was a very good man to deal with. I&rsquo;ll miss him,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you know how much a funeral costs here?&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;A lot, I know. You have Jans to bury? They found him?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, they found him. Down by Castell del Ferro. It will be tomorrow afternoon. Did you know I used to work the boat with him when we were first married?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That was on Babosa. At least Canaillas is paid for now.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We must find them. Whoever it was.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; She looked even more sad.</p>
				<p>We didn&rsquo;t say anything more for a bit and we drank our brandies. She looked at my face as if hoping to find some answer there. And then at Guy. Perhaps she did.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, Mr Guy. This is what you need.&rdquo; She took a small folded piece of paper from her sleeve and gave it to him. &ldquo;He was the boys&rsquo; second cousin but he is no family now. You can do what you must.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am sorry too, Camilla,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I am sorry as well. As I say, it is hard growing up. I will be their father now. What do I need to know?&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What do you need to know?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;To meet Nottambulo,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes me. There are bills to be paid.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good. Have you pen and paper?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>She got them but he indicated me, so I took them and I wrote down a number and slid it across to her. She looked at it, puzzled.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It will be like this. Read it backwards. Place, time, date. No spaces. If there is company go six miles south and four west-south-west.&rdquo; I drew a line in the air. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s still a problem, go the same but backwards. East-south-east. I will find you. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll come on this.&rdquo; Guy passed her a cheap mobile phone and a charger. &ldquo;Turn it on once a day for ten minutes and then turn it off. If you have a problem you can text to the number saved in the phone. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, Mr Guy, Simon. I will be there.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay. Hasta luego. We have work to do.&rdquo; He pressed a bundle of 500 Euro dollars into her hand.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hasta luego, Guy, Hasta luego, Simon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I shut the door quietly behind us and we went. Happy re-materialised beside us. It wasn&rsquo;t that far back to the town so we walked this time and went into a different bar.</p>
				<p>I ordered coffee and another taxi. Guy sat down with an old man who looked up hopefully over a draughts board. They began a game. Happy sat down and watched, trying not to take up too much space. I stood at the bar. The coffee was good and I was thinking of ordering more when the taxi pulled up.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Finish up, Father, we have a tide to catch,&rdquo; I said to Guy.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There are no tides in the Mediterranean, young man,&rdquo; the old man said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The young are very stupid,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Is this one your son too?&rdquo; the old man said, pointing at Happiness and grinning.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No, he is my slave,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>Guy sat in the front of the taxi and chatted with the driver in Spanish. The man told him all about where he lived and what his wife was like and his children. When we got to the quiet street in Almeria he put his gun into the man&rsquo;s face and tucked a 50 Euro note into his shirt pocket and said, &ldquo;Nice to meet you Rolando. Maybe I&rsquo;ll look you up sometime. What did you do tonight?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Senor?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Think carefully. What did you do tonight?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I sat in my car in Adra, Senor. Not many fares tonight. Very quiet night. Didn&rsquo;t see anyone. Didn&rsquo;t go anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Well done, Rolando. Hasta luego.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>A man came out from the back of the house, gave us a knowing look and walked on quickly. There was a light coming from a low room at the end of the garden and the sound of pop music playing quietly. We walked silently up the path and fitted silencers. I had a good look at the door.</p>
				<p>Guy took one side and I the other. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; I said in a low voice. They nodded. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Happiness put his boot against the door near the hinges with an explosive kick and the whole thing fell inwards. We followed it fast. One of them started to reach for a shotgun that was lying on the bench, but I had time to hit him in the face with my left hand, and he sat and held his nose instead. The other two just stared at the muzzles of the guns facing them and didn&rsquo;t move.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Which one of you is Victor?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>Two of them flicked their eyes at the one I&rsquo;d hit.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. You two must come with us also but we do not need to hurt you unless we have to. Understand?&rdquo; They nodded enthusiastically.</p>
				<p>We cuffed them together in a chain and put them in the back of the old Peugeot that was standing on the drive. Guy and I collected up a few kilos of this and that, put the shotgun and some handguns into a convenient holdall and put it in the boot. Happy added some AKs and an old Model L that he found in a cupboard at the back. Another customer turned up but he ran away quickly when he saw Happy.</p>
				<p>It was a bit of a squeeze getting Happy into the back with them but we made them pile up a bit. Guy sat in the front. I drove us sedately back to Adra and parked in shadow by the docks. It was dead quiet, not even a cat moving. I walked to the end of the mole and shone my torch out to sea. Sam answered my signal with a single flash from hers.</p>
				<p>She backed Nottambulo very neatly in by the ladder and we chased them onto her and followed ourselves quickly and quietly with the spoils. Sam had us moving the instant my foot hit the deck and we were away into the black darkness. I clicked another cuff onto the hand of one and an eyebolt in the load bay just in case. Victor was looking wildly about but the other two were accepting the situation fairly calmly.</p>
				<p>We made a good few miles until we had sunk the lights of the town and then Guy said, &ldquo;Shall we do this?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Might as well.&rdquo; I told Sam to bring her down to a stop and found the flask of coffee that Asif had put in the binnacle locker for me. I poured each of them a plastic mug full and we went forward to look at our captives.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Here.&rdquo; I passed Happiness the keys. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at Mr Victor.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>He brought the man up in front of us, pinned by his grip on each arm. The young Spaniard had a wide brutal face and such dark irises to his eyes that they seemed black.</p>
				<p>Guy looked into his face with interest. &ldquo;Hello, Victor, my name is Guy. What is it we want to know, Simon?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We want to know who he&rsquo;s been dealing with, which growers or dealers, and what his arrangements with them are.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;There we go, that&rsquo;s what we want to know. Would you care to tell us? No. Thought not. Over to you, man of knots.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I bound his wrists together with a figure of eight that would tighten and not slip.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Over he goes, Happy, take it up slow, Sam. Don&rsquo;t want to pull him apart,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>We towed him up to more or less full speed, kept him at that for a while and then slowed down to see what had happened. At eighty knots he was skating across the sea like it was a hard surface, which to him it must have been. He was alive but not conscious so we put him in the bilges and carried on towards home.</p>
				<p>Guy had a play with Victor&rsquo;s phone and downloaded its contents onto a small laptop. I stood at the wheel with Sam and kept lookout, Happy concentrated on a section of the engine cowling.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting the feel of her,&rdquo; I said in Sam&rsquo;s ear.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am, aren&rsquo;t I. I wish I could have come with you though.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Maybe next time. But who would drive the boat? I had a man called Martin who would do that for me, but these guys shot him.&rdquo; I pointed to the three young Spaniards.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s coming round.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She was right, he was. We sat him up and slapped him a bit to get his attention.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey, Victor, how&rsquo;re you doing?&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look so great. Would you like to tell us what we want to know now, or would you like to go back in?&rdquo; The brutish face stared back at him with fear, but also stubbornness. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of the person you are intending to buy from in the Rif?&rdquo; There was no response. &ldquo;Good for you, old son. It&rsquo;s no fun if you give in too easily. In he goes, lads.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We slung him over the stern of the boat and Sam took us back up to speed.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Not so long this time. Don&rsquo;t want to waste too much time waiting for him to come round,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>We had slowed down almost to a walk and he was thrashing about, trying not to drown when he suddenly disappeared. Happy and I pulled on the rope and he popped back up. We pulled him back aboard and discovered that there was a sizeable piece missing from one of his calves.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We seem to be fishing,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put him back in and see if it happens again.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Parar! Parar! I will tell you. I will tell you,&rdquo; the man said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay, if you want to. So what were you guys up to then?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;My leg. I am bleeding.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Tell me what I want to know or go back in.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, okay. We were going to take this boat from you and use it from this side. We have a pick-up in Ras Kebdana. We planned to load up at the Red Beach, go meet Jans to bring it in and come back in empty ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;But Jans wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No, Jans wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How did you make him come to the meeting?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;His son, Angelo. We put Angelo on Canaillas and made him.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Who was going to sell to you from the Rif?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Afra. His name is Afra.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Afra who?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Jout, something like that.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Afra Saliba, second son of Mochadem Djout,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You know?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Of course I know. Right then, thank you, Victor, that was very helpful. Now I&rsquo;m going to ask you to promise never to do anything like this again. You promise?&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>Victor nodded vehemently. &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. So now you drink some coffee and we will put a tourniquet on your leg and then you can make a phone call for me. After that we will take you back to Spain, yes? Good.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>His two friends encouraged him, I poured him a mug of coffee and put a lot of sugar in it. Now that he had given in he was no more trouble. He didn&rsquo;t really seem to understand what had happened to his leg, I don&rsquo;t think it can have started to hurt yet, but that wasn&rsquo;t going to matter. Guy showed Sam and me his phone. He had stored a number under the name &lsquo;Afra&rsquo;.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What a fuckwit,&rdquo; he said under his breath.</p>
				<p>Guy coached him for a bit and made him practise. I wrote the important place names and the time and date on a piece of cardboard in felt pen to help him. He couldn&rsquo;t hold the phone because his hands had lost their feeling from the rope so Guy dialled for him and held the phone to his ear. We got a sleepy voice on the other end cursing us in Tashelheit and then Arabic and then Spanish, but he recognised Victor and the quantity of the order got his attention. He tried to argue the price up but Guy shook his head and Victor held out for the going rate. The deal was done and the exchange arranged. Guy disconnected the call.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well done, Victor. I think we should cut you in for a little bit of this,&rdquo; he said. Victor looked pleased, so did his companions. &ldquo;Okay, Sam, you can turn us around and take us back to Adra now. Simon, I think we should set those two free now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll just get the keys.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I went to Sam at the wheel and said, &ldquo;Can I borrow back that .32 for a minute? I don&rsquo;t want to make a mess.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I could&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Never mind.&rdquo; She offered me her bum and I slid the little gun out from under the waistband of her jeans and put it in my trouser pocket.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If you two lean forward, I&rsquo;m going to come behind you and un-cuff you,&rdquo; I said. They did so and I put a bullet through the brain-stem of each of them in such quick succession that they hit the deck almost simultaneously.</p>
				<p>Victor looked confused for a moment and then his attention was drawn to his chest where he saw the dark wooden haft of a knife protruding from it, just over his heart. His eyes went out and his head dropped forward. Guy slowly withdrew his blade and wiped it on the man&rsquo;s shirt.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You lot can clear up. Is there any coffee left?&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>Sam stayed at the wheel all the way back. She seemed tireless. Asif looked surprised when she guided Nottambulo gently into the side of the pontoon. I threw him the painter and stepped off with the stern line in my hand.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home for a nap. Come up about lunch time,&rdquo; Guy said to me, and walked off to the waiting Range Rover.</p>
				<p>Happy got into the Hilux, waved, yawned and departed.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fancy a beer?&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;I need to wind down a bit before I go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We crossed the road to the Rif hotel. It was just beginning to get light and it was cool and lovely in the garden. I kicked the youngster in whites who was asleep on one of the loungers by the pool and said, &ldquo;Two beers, quick.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And two towels,&rdquo; Sam said. She peeled her clothes off and dove cleanly through the still surface of the water and did a breast-stroke along the bottom of the pool. The boy came back, put a tray with two tall glasses of beer on a table and looked around for Sam to give her the towels draped over his arm. Her head broke the surface and he was about to speak when he saw that she was naked. He dropped the towels and ran away.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Something I said?&rdquo; She grinned up at me.</p>
				<p>It looked too good, so I took a mouthful of beer to get rid of the taste of coffee and cordite and joined her.</p>
				<p>She tried to drown me, probably in fun, but I got hold of one of her feet and lifted it up until she took hold of me in such a way that I had to let it back down again. We horsed about for a bit and then got out and sat in the towels drinking our beers.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;This is so much more fun than I thought it would be,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m amazed that Guy&rsquo;s letting you do this,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very sweet of him.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t find the killing a problem?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re Guy&rsquo;s daughter, you get used to it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I felt pretty rough my first time but it&rsquo;s amazing how quickly you adapt, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Has to happen to us all, allegedly.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So they say. It might happen to us rather sooner than most if we keep doing this though.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Maybe. That was very neat, the way you dispatched those two. I shall study you, Mr Ellice.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You seem to be a quick learner, Miss Wealden.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Why thank you, master.&rdquo; She got up and came and sat on my lap facing me and unpeeled her towel. &ldquo;What do you fancy doing next, then?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Er&hellip;&rdquo; I seemed to be having trouble making a sentence.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you think of anything?&rdquo; she wriggled about a bit.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think we should go back to my flat. Now,&rdquo; I said, grabbing hold of her and lifting her off my lap while it was still possible to do so.</p>

				<h2>Feeding the birds</h2>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get that girl to make us some coffee,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>I woke up enough to grab hold of her wrist, &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Let go. All I want is some coffee. It&rsquo;s what she&rsquo;s for isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Just be nice to her, okay.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Or I won&rsquo;t sleep with you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;ll find someone else, perhaps someone with a bigger prick.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She took my dressing gown and went out of the room. I had a look to check that she wasn&rsquo;t serious about that and lay back and stared at the ceiling. The last few days had been rather busy and I didn&rsquo;t feel much like leaping out of bed.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I should think Happy would be a good bet,&rdquo; she said, coming back in. &ldquo;Coffee on the balcony if you want it. Come on, things to do. I need to go shopping.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Shopping?&rdquo; I sat up and had a good stretch. I supposed I would get up, I could always go back to bed later. She had my dressing gown on so I wrapped a towel round myself and went out to the balcony. The sounds of the day coming up from the city seemed distant and irrelevant to the three of us up here in my lovely flat.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, shopping. Don&rsquo;t you have work to do?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No. Yes. Later. What are you, my boss now?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m thinking about it. How do you get promotion around here?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Kill the person you want to replace, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That what you did?&rdquo; She passed me a cup full of strong black coffee.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sort of.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Andy?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. You knew him?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I sort of fancied him I think. It was a while ago. He was quite cute in a way as I remember.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If you say so.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I do. What happened?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He was Guy&rsquo;s main man. All I wanted to do was drive the boat and leave the rest to him but he wouldn&rsquo;t leave it be; kept giving me instructions like he was my boss. One day he wanted me to come with him into the hills on a buying trip and I thought he wanted to talk, but he tried to kill me. That&rsquo;s why I ended up being involved with the buying and all the rest of it. It was hard to say no after I&rsquo;d just killed him.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not quite what happened.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He was drinking too much so Dad poured a bottle of scotch down him and told him you&rsquo;d asked permission to bump him off. He told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What a bastard.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We drank our coffee in silence for a bit.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Why did you ask if you already knew?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Just wondered what you&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway, about Andy I mean. You&rsquo;re the boat man. All this would be fucked without you and that boat. Wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yup. In Europe hash is worth real money, here it&rsquo;s just an agricultural commodity. Getting it there is the only game that counts, and that&rsquo;s what I do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Exactly. So if I were to replace you, say, just for the sake of argument, I&rsquo;d need to&hellip;&rdquo; she held up a hand and started checking the items of on her fingers, &ldquo;Before I bumped you off I&rsquo;d need to&hellip; handle Nottambulo - I can do that; handle the men - I&rsquo;m working on that one; - handle the business up in the hills. That&rsquo;s next.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I appreciate the warning. Do you want my job or Guy&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t make any difference. Neither actually; I just want to have a little fun, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m going to have some fun this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Doing what, in particular?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh for fuck&rsquo;s sake. Order some breakfast. I&rsquo;m going for a shower. No don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I found Soumaiya in the kitchen. She was still dressed like a good Muslim woman and she looked sorry for me. I didn&rsquo;t understand why at the time. I asked her to make some scrambled eggs in my politest Arabic and went for a wash.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to need some help shopping,&rdquo; Sam said, over the eggs, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going to offer.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Soumaiya, come here a moment.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Be nice to her.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I want her to help me, what do you think I&rsquo;m going to do?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Soumaiya stood before us, looking at the table, waiting.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You speak good English don&rsquo;t you, Soumaiya?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Simon has taught me to speak English, and I have taught him some Tashelheit,&rdquo; Soumaiya said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. I need your help to buy clothes today. Can you be ready in ten minutes?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Soumaiya looked at me, I shrugged my shoulders, she lowered her eyes again and said, &ldquo;I am ready now.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Bye, honey,&rdquo; Sam said, kissing me on the cheek, &ldquo;missing you already.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I looked over the railing of the balcony and watched them go down the street, Sam leading and Soumaiya following behind like the slave that in fact is what she is, though I hadn&rsquo;t been in the habit of thinking her so. The cat dropped off the roof and came to say hello to me.</p>
				<p>I finished the coffee and went out too. I stopped at the store as usual. Romeo was dealing and Happy was sitting by the door looking dangerous with his bulging muscles, mirror shades and the AK propped against the wall next to him. I went over and took the seat beside him. He didn&rsquo;t move or say anything.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You awake, Happy?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So, so.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, been up all night?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hah, very funny.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You want to be a boat man?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You did all right last night, and the night before. There&rsquo;s a place on my crew, if you want it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Who else?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You, me and Sam.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Miss Samantha?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, you&rsquo;ll do it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Now you&rsquo;re mine I&rsquo;ll send someone else to do this shit job and you can get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;By the way, what happened to Tony?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Tony dead,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>I went up to the house. Guy was in his study but the door was open so I went in. It was the room of a man who doesn&rsquo;t care about comfort much. White walls, metal filing cabinets and a lot of tech. He was watching the monitor that showed the cameras at the store. The real cameras I mean, not the old one you can see.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That Romeo is a lazy fuck,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He certainly is.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No concept of customer service at all.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Happy&rsquo;s on my crew.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Told you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent Pete to do his job so he can get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Whatever.&rdquo; He led the way out and shut and locked the door.</p>
				<p>I followed him to the terrace via the bar. Zara was idly flicking through a copy of Country Life.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What do you think about this?&rdquo; she said, showing me a picture of an over-stuffed leather sofa that looked like it belonged in someone&rsquo;s idea of a gentleman&rsquo;s club from the century before the last one.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure it would go with the house,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ignore her, Simon, she&rsquo;s bored.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I am bored. It&rsquo;s living in this useless bloody country. You can&rsquo;t buy anything except plastic furniture and hash.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t live in Mayfair, and if you ask again I&rsquo;ll swap you in for a newer model,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should come out with you on your lovely boat, Simon. Will you take me out for a ride?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think the boy&rsquo;s got as much of that going on as he can handle,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;Besides why would he want you when he can have her?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very nice. You fancy me don&rsquo;t you, Simon?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, Zara, but Guy would kill me if I even thought about it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No I wouldn&rsquo;t, help yourself. Might cheer her up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;d feel all wrong, I&rsquo;d be thinking of you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; Guy said</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s probably not much good in bed. What&rsquo;s she like, Simon? A bit inexperienced I expect?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Do you think we could talk about something else. Like maybe getting ready for this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No need, it&rsquo;s all taken care of,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;How can it possibly all be taken care of? Who by?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;By me and my girl, of course.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Really? By you and Sam?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s persuaded me to let her join in the fun and games. I wouldn&rsquo;t before but she&rsquo;s grown up a lot recently and I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I&rsquo;ve sent her ahead to see to the horses. We&rsquo;ll catch her up later.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;But, you&rsquo;re going to&hellip; She might have to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know. Just relax and don&rsquo;t worry about it. Have a little lunch with me and then we&rsquo;ll go for a drive.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Later that afternoon I raised my field glasses, rested my elbows on a rock and had a good look down over the ledge at the pass below me. Nothing to see. I looked at a few rocks and they looked like rocks. I let my attention diffuse, as one does when tracking, looking for the thing that doesn&rsquo;t fit. Nothing. I was definitely in the right place so there was nothing I could do about it.</p>
				<p>This wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable so I sat up and leant back against a relatively smooth bit of the cliff face; it was warm from the sun. I looked up into the cloudless blue sky until it ceased to be blue and became that pale no-colour with no name.&nbsp; There was no shade There was no shade up here and I had not thought to bring water. I like being up in the mountains; they change the perspective of things, generally for the better. They&rsquo;re uncomplicated and unequivocal. I understand why the ancient Romans believed the gods lived in the mountains.</p>
				<p>A lizard came out from a crack and hung on the face of the rock looking at me. For a while I didn&rsquo;t move and neither did he, then a lammergeier appeared, wheeling silently above, lifted by the air rising up the face of the Ametek, and then side-slipped away out of sight again. When I looked back, the lizard had gone.</p>
				<p>A few hundred feet below me lay the pass that led down to Mesbar and eventually the coast. The path itself was barely distinguishable on the stony ground; just a hint of a line winding between the boulders.</p>
				<p>I pulled out the old paperback copy of <em>The Long Goodbye</em> that I had stuck down the back of my trousers next to my .38 and stretched out my legs. I held the book so that my peripheral vision included the killing ground below, and read for a while. The sun strengthened, the shadows retreated slowly under the rocks and the stone that I was sitting on got harder. The lizard reappeared without me noticing him arrive. In the book Marlowe sat in a bar and drank a long, cold highball. Lucky bastard.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Bud, are they there?&rdquo; I said to the lizard. He stayed where he was but didn&rsquo;t answer me.</p>
				<p>There was a flicker of movement down there. I folded a corner to mark my place, put the book down and settled down beside the TAC-50, which was sitting on its little legs, pointing out across the valley like a sinister black finger. I lifted it, tucked the butt into my shoulder and used the scope to have a look. It was almost as good as the binoculars.</p>
				<p>A caravan of mounted men and pack animals nodded into view from the hidden ground on the far side of the pass. They toiled up to the ridge and their leader paused to shade his eyes and scan the way down. His horse twitched its ears forward and back and snorted at the void before it. The man kicked it on and then settled back into the saddle and let his body sway loosely as it started to pick its way delicately downwards. He held the reins against the pommel in one hand and the other cradled an assault rifle against his thigh. I put the crosshairs on his chest and rested my index finger on the trigger.</p>
				<p>There were six in all. Well mounted on small, tough horses which could do this all day and would make the best of any grazing, however poor. The men were a lot like their horses, lean and tough looking. Apart from their headscarves, some of which may once have been white or blue, they wore dusty red and orange tunics and trousers; the same tones and shades as the landscape around them. A string of six mules, each one tied to the next, made up the centre of the group. They carried uniform square bales wrapped in coarse hessian, twelve in all. One of them kicked at a fly on his belly without breaking step. Unlike the horses, they let their heads hang and accepted their fate.</p>
				<p>The last man came over the ridge and started down. The group was bunching up as the leading animals were slowed by the steepness of the path. Behind them, on the far slope something moved and a straight line, which was a gun barrel, became visible. Now I could see that the rifle was attached to a man shrouded in sandy rock-coloured cloths.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ah ha,&rdquo; I said to no one in particular.</p>
				<p>The lead horse stopped and his rider fell forward out of the saddle. He hit the ground like a dropped sack and didn&rsquo;t move. The sound of the shot floated up to me, and was followed by another and then many more. Four men under camouflage, waiting, still and silent among the rocks, one behind, one in front and one to each side, shot and killed five of the men in the first few seconds. The track became a bedlam of plunging horses. The mules, feet planted and showing the whites of their eyes, tried to back up. The last man got his horse round and, lying low on its back, raced for the top of the pass. I swung the heavy rifle to get a bead on him but a searching shot from below brought the animal down before I could get to him. It pinned him to the ground and thrashed madly, unable to get to its feet. The man tried desperately to get his leg out from under it and beat at it with his fists, but it was dying and could not get up.</p>
				<p>Two of the men calmed the horses, started to check that the dead were dead and begin to search them. The third stood to one side watching. The fourth climbed back up to the struggling man and horse. He shot the horse and then the man and then turned to face up towards me. He unwound his headscarf and a mass of fair hair came free. It was Sam. She waved to me, though I doubt if she could see me, so I stood up and waved back.</p>
				<p>I sat down and began to pack the sniper&rsquo;s rifle back into its case. Down on the pass Sam pulled a long knife from her boot and turned back to the dead man. The lammergeier returned and began to circle, waiting for its turn.</p>
				<p>It was hard going, getting back down from the high place with the weight of the big gun on my back, and I was sweating when I let myself down off the last rock face onto the slope of scree and boulder. I had to move carefully so that I didn&rsquo;t start any rocks bounding down onto the horses below.</p>
				<p>I looked back up at the buttress of bare rock I had just come down. Above it at least twenty of the massive birds were circling now.</p>
				<p>The horses whinnied gently and tossed their heads when I got back to them. I tightened their girths, strapped the rifle case to one and mounted the other. I didn&rsquo;t bother to lead the pack animal, it would follow along anyway. I pushed on as fast as I could, given the uneven nature of the ground, as I had to skirt the shoulder of the Ametek before I could turn back to join the dirt road that wound up towards the pass and rejoin the others. It was good to be on a horse by myself riding through the mountains. When I got to the track I moved up into a fast canter and arrived at the place where we&rsquo;d left the vehicles in a satisfactory cloud of dust. We had come in two of the big Toyotas, each with a horse box behind and Guy&rsquo;s white Range Rover and they were tucked in under a group of cedars to one side of the road.</p>
				<p>The birds had disappeared from the sky and the caravan of horses and mules was just coming into view out of the fold of land that hid the beginning of the path up to the pass.</p>
				<p>I handed the horses to Habib the horsemaster, threw the TAC-50 into the boot of the Range Rover, took a bottle of water from the cooler and then sat on a flat rock in the shade to watch them arrive.</p>
				<p>Sam was leading. Now I saw what she&rsquo;d meant by shopping. She had discarded her camouflage, her head was bare, her mane of fair hair flowing about her shoulders, but other than that she was an Arabian prince. She had a black sirwal, like trousers but looser, that suit riding so well, tucked into her boots. Above that was a simple, dark maroon tunic and over all a jet-black bisht, or cloak, heavily embroidered with gold thread. At her belt was the gleam of the traditional silver dagger.</p>
				<p>She sat her horse with the ease of complete confidence and the AK-47 slung across her back in no way detracted from the look. There was light in her eyes and laughter bubbling up out of her.</p>
				<p>She jumped off her horse, threw her arms around me and kissed me, and then did a little dance in the dust.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You having a good day then?&rdquo; I said, grinning in spite of myself, for her joy was irresistible.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I am. Dad said we&rsquo;d be feeding the birds and I didn&rsquo;t get it, but I do now. Not a shot fired, not by any of them I mean. Isn&rsquo;t that good? I got that one that tried to run, did you see?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw. A fine shot. No need for me up there at all.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, you know Dad, he likes to make certain. Don&rsquo;t you, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Karim led one half of the string of baggage animals to one side, followed by Happy with the rest, and Guy bringing up the rear, walked his horse up to us. He sat a little slouched with his gun resting across the pommel. He looked very relaxed, but then he almost always does.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I what?&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Like to be sure,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Always. You must have made good time to beat us back. See anything at all?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Nothing but the birds,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Now, Daughter, you can earn your pleasures. I&rsquo;m driving back with Simon. You can see the load safely back to the store and help Habib get all these animals away to the farm. Think you can manage that?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>For an instant a flicker of anger flashed across her face and was gone.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, Daddy, I think I can manage that.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Here, Happiness.&rdquo; He tossed his AK to the big man who caught it with a grin, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the boss, understand?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I could see that this brightened Sam up.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be long. I&rsquo;ll see you at the house. Ready?&rdquo; This to me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Normally I would have been the one packing and sorting, or at least supervising the packing and sorting. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how I felt about the change. Or about what I&rsquo;d witnessed that afternoon. As I got into the passenger side of the car I took the .38 from out of my waistband, but not my book; I&rsquo;d left it up on the rocks above the pass. Bugger.</p>
				<p>Guy drove fast and well, letting the heavy car slide on the corners a bit just for the fun of it, and raising a lot of dust. He must be as old as my father but he doesn&rsquo;t look that old and he doesn&rsquo;t drive old. I could tell that he was having a good day. The rattle of the stones abruptly stopped and became a steady hum as we hit the tarmac. He put his foot down and we flew back towards Nador.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Has she killed many people?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You shocked, old son?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Maybe a bit.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay for the men but not the girls, huh?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Something like that.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She in&rsquo;t just for decoration you know. She&rsquo;s a working girl now and she&rsquo;s my daughter. What did you expect?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey, I get that. Just let me catch up, will you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be too slow about it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best. I take it one of those lads was one of the chief&rsquo;s sons?&rdquo; I said, changing the subject.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming so.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Has he got any left?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;One, I think.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He started it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way of these people, you know that. There&rsquo;s feuds still going on up there that started centuries ago. If I did anything less they&rsquo;d think I was a pussy.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Any hint of weakness and all the bribe money in the world won&rsquo;t keep Nador in my hands.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Guy drifted onto the gravel skirt of the road to overtake a lorry on the wrong side. A boy pulled at his goat to get it out of the way. We missed it by at least a couple of inches. At this speed we&rsquo;d be back in Nador in less than an hour.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I wanted to talk to you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I guessed.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Between you and me, it&rsquo;s you and Nottambulo that have made the difference recently. In the year you&rsquo;ve been here. For better and for worse.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told you this before, but we&rsquo;re shipping more than three times what we used to, and thanks to you, we haven&rsquo;t lost a load yet. I used to reckon on losing about one in five with the containers. Less than that with the lorry but that was much smaller loads. If I&rsquo;d known, I wouldn&rsquo;t have agreed to such a high percentage.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;At three times the volume, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re losing out,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying I am.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not tempted to get your own boat and replace me with Sam then? She seems to be thinking that way.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You should know. No, my daughter, my lovely daughter, is, how shall I put it, easily bored. She&rsquo;s having fun right now, but when this gets routine, forget it. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t mind her taking part at the moment; I&rsquo;ll be there with her, or you will, and in a while she&rsquo;ll get bored with it and stop.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You trust me to look after her? I&rsquo;m flattered.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You know what they call you?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Who? I didn&rsquo;t know they called me anything.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The locals. Simon SarSour. Do you know what SarSour means?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Cockroach.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ever tried to kill a cockroach?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You have to hit it pretty hard.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I suppose you do.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another thing I bet you haven&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You and Sam work very well together, I&rsquo;ve been watching. Like you&rsquo;ve known each other a lot longer than you have. You automatically cover each other&rsquo;s backs and the men are very careful around you when you&rsquo;re together. It&rsquo;s interesting.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t noticed.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s interesting in itself.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I know she doesn&rsquo;t look it, but she&rsquo;s pretty tough. I&rsquo;ve learned over the years to trust her to look after herself. It&rsquo;s usually the other people who get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You said that before.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Probably. So what I&rsquo;m saying is, go on doing what you&rsquo;re doing for as long as you want and make a lot of money. And when you begin to feel like you&rsquo;ve had enough, let me know and I&rsquo;ll either try to buy Nottambulo off you or get you to help me come by another. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. This is what I do and I&rsquo;m going to keep right on doing it until I want to do something else but I know it&rsquo;s not the same for you, or her. Get me?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve had enough and you want to go and she wants to go too, that&rsquo;s not a problem, okay? You&rsquo;re good for her. You get me?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think so. I&rsquo;m not sure she&rsquo;s good for me.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your problem.&rdquo; He grinned at me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I wanted to do this today with my girl, just her and me. Tomorrow, why don&rsquo;t the three of us go and see the old man up in the hills together? What do you say? Like a family day out.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I looked at him.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I think I could handle another ride up into the hills. Count me in.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;After that I&rsquo;m going to let you two do most of the work until she gets bored, or you decide to call it a day. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good, that&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Guy stopped the Range Rover in front of the car-port and we got out. A servant appeared to re-fuel and clean it.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stick around for a bit. Have a swim. Sam&rsquo;ll be back in a bit. I must go to the office but I&rsquo;ll meet you by the pool for a drink shortly. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I wandered thoughtfully off to the pool. I washed the sweat and dust of the day off myself in the outside shower, helped myself to a pair of trunks from the pile and swam for a bit. It&rsquo;s a good pool, pretty big for a private house, even in this neighbourhood, and it doesn&rsquo;t get used much so it&rsquo;s always fresh. Like everything else there, Guy had it kept immaculately clean. I swam lengths fast enough to work on my fitness for a bit and then floated on my back, looking up at the empty sky, while I got my breath back. It was like being nowhere. With the water supporting me from underneath and the blank sky above me, I could be just a body, just a spirit. No past, no future, no needs or desires, no problems.</p>
				<p>I took a big breath, rolled down into the water and swam to the bottom. I turned on my back, facing up and blew a small stream of bubbles until my lungs were completely empty, then put my legs underneath me and pushed myself explosively up to the surface. I took a breath and swam slowly to the side and got out.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You looked very relaxed there,&rdquo; Zara said from one of the poolside loungers.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I long ago worked out that I&rsquo;m very unlikely to come to any harm while I&rsquo;m in the water. It would make a mess of the pool,&rdquo; I said, and lay down on the next lounger.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ha, very good. You&rsquo;re quite right. Careful, I might jump you.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t use me to wind Guy up while he&rsquo;s not around.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it, he&rsquo;s always around, or watching. Trouble is, I think he really wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not find out, shall we.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Shame.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The pool boy is quite pretty.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, I tried. Too scared.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame him, no offence.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;None taken. Drink?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Thanks. A beer.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She raised a languid arm and clicked her fingers. The boy ran over for the order.</p>
				<p>When he had brought a tall glass of golden liquid, with the glass already sweating, for me, and more of the makings of G and T for Zara I raised my glass to her and said, &ldquo;Cheers.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Back at you, Mr Ellice.&rdquo; She lowered the level in her glass and sighed. She makes her drinks about fifty-fifty and uses a tall glass.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say one thing for you, if life were a drinking competition you&rsquo;d be a champion,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You mean it isn&rsquo;t? Well, almost everyone&rsquo;s good at something and I just happen to be good at this.&rdquo; She gave another demonstration with obvious satisfaction. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a gift I never take for granted. If it weren&rsquo;t for this I&rsquo;d become a nuisance and Guy would have me taken out into the desert,&rdquo; she waved an arm to indicate the massive dry hinterland of the African continent. &ldquo;Just keep the juice coming and I&rsquo;m your good-time girl with the perfect breasts.&rdquo; She raised her chest and gave them a little shake to emphasise the point.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Very nice.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I bet you wish that girl had a pair like these.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s room for variety.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Thinks she&rsquo;s action woman, that one.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You think she isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What I think about her isn&rsquo;t fit for your delicate ears, sweetheart, but I&rsquo;ll tell you, I think she&rsquo;s trouble. And if you think she gives a flying fuck about you, you&rsquo;re wrong. She doesn&rsquo;t and never will.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great fuck by the way, and I&rsquo;d sooner have her watching my back on a job than any of the others,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You just think I&rsquo;m jealous because she&rsquo;s younger than me and likes playing with guns.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You sound jealous.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m wrong.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re right, either.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What really gets me is the way Guy looks at her. Like he respects her.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;So? Why shouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get it do you? Who else does he respect then? Go on name someone?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I tried thinking about that and didn&rsquo;t like what I thought.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;He finds people useful or convenient and that&rsquo;s about it. She&rsquo;s the same and that&rsquo;s why he respects her,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we all?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>She took a long drink and settled back on the lounger. &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right, we&rsquo;re all just a fucking convenience to one another in the end. Or, in my case, a non-fucking convenience. Just promise me one thing?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;If you decide to leave, fuck me before you tell him.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very strange woman. Don&rsquo;t you think about anything else?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Soft furnishings. Mainly I think about sex and soft furnishings.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Guy appeared and we all moved to the table under the pergola. I joined him in some of the contents of the scotch bottle. The day began to become evening in the beautiful way it does there. Zara flicked through Homes and Gardens and Guy spread out a bundle of newspapers and began to pick through them. I watched the sun slipping softly down towards the horizon and thought about Sam.</p>
				<p>One of the Land Cruisers pulled up to the gate, followed by a white Hilux and they were let in.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Ah, good,&rdquo; Guy said, and put down his paper.</p>
				<p>A slim Arab came through the archway and approached us with the total assurance of someone used to instant obedience from all those around him. He had a black keffiyeh arranged as a shemagh, covering the head and most of the face, and a black bisht heavily embroidered with gold thread flowed about him as he walked. I involuntarily thought about where I&rsquo;d left my gun, and then remembered. Happy and Karim appeared. Happy was carrying a large wicker basket.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Put that on the grass, it may leak,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>Sam uncovered her head. She looked radiant. She strode up to us and made her report. &ldquo;All good, boss. No problems. Last load of horses on the way to the farm now, put the bales in the store, Karim says it&rsquo;s good stuff, and here we are.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>The men stood respectfully behind her.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Well done.&rdquo; Guy pulled two fat bundles of notes out from under the newspapers and tossed them to her. She took them and threw them accurately, one each, to the men who caught them and examined them with big grins.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>They all nodded.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Happy, you be here at ten tomorrow. If you get drunk and are late I will find you. Even if you are dead I will find you. Understand?&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, Oya.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Good. Off you go.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, boss.&rdquo; They didn&rsquo;t look to me or Guy for confirmation, they just went.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What a brilliant day,&rdquo; Sam said, sitting down. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I came here for.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Glad you like it, sweetheart,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Want a drink, Oya?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fuck yes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What is an Oya?&rdquo; I said, passing her three fingers of scotch with a little ice.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Warrior goddess of the Yoruba,&rdquo; Sam said, &ldquo;apparently. I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s a compliment.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Yoruba?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Happy&rsquo;s a Yoruba,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Funny, I thought he was Nigerian,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, they say you learn something new everyday,&rdquo; Guy said, with a malicious smile.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that on your arm, dear?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Oh, I missed some,&rdquo; Sam said, looking. &ldquo;I had a quick wash in a stream on the way down.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say it suits you,&rdquo; Guy said. &ldquo;Both the name and the decoration.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say so too,&rdquo; she said, with immense complacency, smiling at us all. &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;ve found my vocation at last.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the basket?&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;A present for Mochadem Djout,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;The heads of six of his men, including one of his sons,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You sick bastards,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to deliver them to him tomorrow,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;Are we going to eat soon? I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Guy snapped his fingers and the boy ran up. &ldquo;Supper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Something good and don&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Have we got any decent champagne around here?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Bound to have,&rdquo; Guy said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, get it cooling. I&rsquo;m going for a wash and brush up.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You heard her,&rdquo; Guy said to the boy.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Four bottles.&rdquo; She held up some fingers. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come and scrub my back?&rdquo; she said to me, stretching and moving her thighs against each other.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very subtle, dear,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;It is, for me, Auntie,&rdquo; Sam said. &ldquo;Up to you,&rdquo; she said to me, rising and leaving. I watched her go.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Bitch on heat,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>Guy was looking at me, enjoying the situation. &ldquo;You might as well,&rdquo; he said.</p>
				<p>I decided that sitting there wasn&rsquo;t going to be any better than not sitting there, so I got up and followed her. I found her in the guest quarters. She was already naked and there was more blood on her than I had realised. It had run down inside her sleeves.</p>
				<p>She saw me looking and said, &ldquo;Ever fucked a girl covered in other men&rsquo;s blood?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Not as I remember.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s your chance.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>When she had finished with me, and I had finished with her, which didn&rsquo;t take long, she was already half way there, we stood under the shower and I scrubbed her back and washed away the blood from her arms and sides.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, I needed that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Glad to be of service.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Go on out, I&rsquo;ll be there in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>I wasn&rsquo;t entirely comfortable about the reception I was going to get from the others so I stood by the doorway for a bit looking at the scene. All the pieces of it were the usual pieces, but the feeling wasn&rsquo;t the same. The golden light of the lowering sun was cheap and vulgar and the sweet scent of the jasmine hid an undertone of decay. Or maybe it was just me.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey, Si.&rdquo; She came up behind me, put an arm around my waist and leant against me. She&rsquo;d put on slacks and loose top. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s you and me go and drink some of that champagne, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Okay, Oya,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Hey, I am what I am. Okay?&rdquo; She seemed to have caught my mood.</p>
				<p>I pulled her round in front of me so that I could see her properly. She looked back at me, fearlessly.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very beautiful,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;But not as nice as you thought I was?&rdquo; she said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;What does nice mean anyway?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You are what you are, and I am what I am.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t argue with that.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Better drink some champagne then,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Bloody good plan, Si.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>We walked out together, arm in arm, round the pool, which glowed in its own limpid light, and there was an ice-bucket with champagne in it on the table.</p>
				<p>Guy wasn&rsquo;t at the table but Zara was. We pulled a pair of chairs close to each other and sat down.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t take long,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Stop it,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Be nice, Auntie,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;They really are heads,&rdquo; Zara said, indicating the basket, &ldquo;I went to have a look.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Yes, they really are,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;You lot are unbelievable. How can you like killing people?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Who said we like it?&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Shall we drink that champagne then, or are we just going to look at it?&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>I thumbed the cork off, shooting it into the pool, and filled glasses.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Well, my children,&rdquo; Guy said, rejoining us and accepting a glass. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the trade.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Dark nights and no more Spaniards,&rdquo; I said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Days like today,&rdquo; Sam said.</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Fuck you all,&rdquo; Zara said.</p>
