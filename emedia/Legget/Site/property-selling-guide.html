					<blockquote>
	              		<p>Here at Leggett Immobilier, we have been helping people sell French properties for more than 20 years, so if the time has come to sell yours, we will be happy to help you out.</p>
		            </blockquote>
					<p>If you would like to put your French property on the market with Leggett Immobilier, please feel free to contact us on:  08700 11 51 51 (UK only) +33 553 608 488 (other) or email <a href="mailto:info@leggett.fr">info@leggett.fr</a> and we will organise for your local Leggett Immobilier agent to contact you.</p>
                    <p>All Leggett Immobilier agents live in the area in which they work, so your local agent will probably be the one that lives closest to you.  This reflects the unique way that Leggett Immobilier is structured.  With offices in France, a network of local agents spread across the country and a cross-section of trusted international marketing techniques to promote your property; Leggett Immobilier is able to reach a wide range of clients, whilst providing you with a consistent local agent to work with you whilst you are selling your property.</p>

                    <p>Should you decide that you would like to market your property with us the process is fairly simple.  Your local agent will contact you to organise a suitable time for them to visit the property you want to sell.  During this visit your Leggett Immmobilier agent will:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide you with an informed valuation based on local property knowledge and discuss the price and pricing strategy for your property sale.</li>
                        <li>Take some details from you to allow them to draw up the 'mandat de vente' – this is a legal document which allows us to market your property.</li>
                        <li>Take photographs of your property and write up notes to allow them to draft your property listing (if the weather is particularly bad, your agent may agree with you that they return another time to take photos of your property.)</li>
                        <li>Request your full DPE (diagnostic de performance énergétique) and discuss the diagnostic tests that you are required to have carried out prior to the sale of your property.</li>
                        <li>Ask you some general questions regarding your property, for example are there any droit de passages (rights of way) across your property? do you have a fosse septique? what condition is the roof in? - these are the types of questions which may be asked by prospective clients.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Following the visit your Leggett Immobilier agent will send you your mandat de vente to sign and send back to the Leggett Immobilier mandat team.  The mandat de vente document is, of course, in French; but should you wish for a standard English translation, please just ask your Leggett Immobilier agent and we will be more than happy to provide you with one.  Only when our in-house mandat team have received your correctly signed mandat de vente can your property listing go live on our website.</p>

                    <div class="blog-post block blue">
						<h2>Mandat de Vente in a nutshell...</h2>
						<hr />
						<ul>
                            <li>A Mandat de Vente is a legally binding document which allows an estate agent to market your property</li>
                            <li>There are several different types of Mandat de Vente, the most common one used by Leggett Immobilier (and most other estate agents, although it is always worth checking) is the 'mandat de vente sans exclusivité'.  This type of mandat allows you to market your property yourself as well as with other estate agents </li>
                            <li>A Mandat de Vente contains information on each person that owns the property and must be signed by all parties to signify that they are all in agreement with the sale of the property</li>
                            <li>The document contains a brief description of the property, as well as the cadastrel references of the parcelles of land included in the sale of the property.  It is important that this information is correct as it can be difficult to iron-out inaccuracies when a sale is agreed on your property</li>
                            <li>Every owner of the property which is being sold must sign and return TWO COPIES of the Mandat de Vente to the Leggett head office.  Our in-house mandat team will then sign both copies, keep one on file and return the other fully signed document to you for your records</li>
                            <li>Should you wish to cancel the Mandat de Vente, you can do so by sending a recorded delivery letter to our mandat team. Before you decide to cancel your mandat it is always worth having a conversation with your Leggett Immobilier agent</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2><span class="post-header">Pulling out all the stops – how we market your property</span></h2>
                    <p>One of the things that we pride ourselves on here at Leggett Immobilier is our ongoing innovation when it comes to marketing properties for our vendors.  We believe that exposing your property to a broad, relevant and engaged pool of potential clients is one of the keys to success.  Our central marketing team work hard exploring new ways to present your property, as beautifully and as widely as possible, to prospective purchasers.</p>

                    <h2><span class="pre-header">Where will we market your property?</span></h2>
                    <p>We work hard to get your property in front of potential purchasers as we believe this is the primary way of generating sales.  We use a variety of different marketing tools which include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Our websites

                                <li>We view our websites as our shop windows and this is a strategy which proves very successful for our international client base.</li>
                                <li>As well as our main website, we also have specialist sites for Leggett Prestige, Leggett Ski and tailored sites for the most popular areas of France.</li>

                                <li>We are one of the few French estate agencies that have been attending property exhibitions for many years and continue to do so every year.  We take all the property  listings on our website to every exhibition.</li>
                                <li>We often run very well attended seminars on 'Life in France' or 'Areas of France' at these exhibitions, and clients are always very keen to talk to our teams and view the properties that we have listed.</li>
                                <li>The exhibitions we attend include all of the major UK foreign property events including:  The France Show, A Place in the Sun (London, Birmingham and Manchester), French Property Show and Second Home International.  We also attend an increasing number of international events.</li>

We have close relationships with journalists in the UK, France and Internationally and are regularly featured in publications such as The Daily Telegraph (UK), The Wall Street Journal (USA), Country Life International, The Financial Times (UK).</li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2><span class="pre-header">Photography</span></h2>
                    <p>The photographs included in the listing of your property are extremely important in attracting potential buyers.  It is for this reason that, whenever possible, we like to have your property pictured with a blue sky, well lit and showing off the most beautiful features.  All Leggett Immobilier agents are trained in property photography and we have an in-house specialist who provides assistance and advice to agents on achieving the highest quality photography possible.</p>

                    <h2><span class="pre-header">Virtual tours</span></h2>
                    <p>As part of the ongoing marketing innovation, Leggett Immobilier pioneered the use of 'virtual-tours' on property listings.  Usually something that vendors are required to pay for, virtual-tours are available to all Leggett Immobilier vendors, free of charge.  Virtual-tours can be made for any property, but are particularly useful for larger properties.  They allow clients to 'virtually' tour a property prior to visiting and are a  great way to whet a client's appetite and excite them prior to their visit.</p>
