            <blockquote>DesArts is a fantastic platform for exploring some of the most brilliant facets of the art and design world. They truly appreciate creators and the time and effort they put into what they do. It's a real honour and a privelege to be involved with them.

            <blockquote>There is so much diverse art and design work on display on DesArts. There is always something new to explore and draw inspiration from. It was very easy to update my own site and I could see the changes immediately. All the tools were there at my disposal – from creating my own homepage to webmail, from online art shop to web traffic analytics. It’s like a one stop shop for any artist.

            <blockquote>Sharing my work on DesArts helped me break out of the isolation of the studio. While I had on occasion shared my images via social media with friends and family and I have maintained a website portfolio for several years, sharing my images with the DesArts community opened up my work to a much larger community and along with that, invaluable feedback. This experience helped me realize the function of social media for artists of any age and standing in the art community and I have connected with patrons, gallerists, and editors as a result.
