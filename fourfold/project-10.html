			<h1>Solution</h1>
			<hr>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">We created a campaign that helped justify the additional cost that businesses have to pay for Mercedes-Benz vans and commercial vehicles – by making Mercedes-Benz vans the only van with an Ancap 5-star rating. With a little extra cost comes all the usual functionality you expect from a Mercedes-Benz vehicle plus safety features you can depend on. After we created the right campaign we went about finding every relevant business in the country that we could send the information on to. We drove to them, we emailed them, we sent them information in the post, we even put on sausage sizzles for workers at companies with large workforces. All helping to keep Mercedes-Benz vans top-of-mind with buyers.</p>

			<h1>Results</h1>
			<hr>
			We generated over 5,000 leads for the sales team – 160 of which were converted in the first 8 weeks after our campaign had finished.
