			<h1>Solution</h1>
			<hr>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">An immediate Google AdWords campaign was executed after carrying out keyword research to ensure the campaign was targeted and would deliver immediate results. We carried out a full report on the website to see how we could optimise the website. High PR Back Links were generated and relevant content posted to the website in order to improve the SEO ranking. We also worked with the Managing Director to improve the sales process and are about to launch a new improved e-commerce website.</p>

			<h1>Results</h1>
			<hr>
			We’ve been working with Vital-Parts for just under 12 months and in that time we’ve managed to increase online leads by over 600%. Sales have increased exponentially and the company is going from strength to strength. In 2016, we’re going to be introducing a new website which will see the company being number one in the category for user experience. For all intents and purposes we’re expecting the company to be the category leader in 3 years with revenue of over 3 million per annum.
