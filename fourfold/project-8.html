		Help re-energise an already successful business in order to become the category leader for Pumice supplies across Europe.

		<h1>Solution
</h1>
		<hr>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">We went back to basics. We helped the business fully understand the category, audience, competition and lastly what they thought their own brand ‘stood for’. Once we asked the right questions we helped them get down on paper how the company is positioned – differentiating between macro and micro objectives. Collectively, we’ve created a plan together that clearly lays out objectives for 2016 that will generate growth and market share - moving them to market leaders in the category by 2018.</p>

		<h1>Results
</h1>
		<hr>
		TBC – but the plan has been extremely well received, and, we’re confident it’s going to be extremely successful.
