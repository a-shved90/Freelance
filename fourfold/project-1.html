			<h1>Brief</h1>
			<hr>
			Get more people to switch from other phone networks to Vodafone. The problem was, they had a poor reputation amongst consumers and were thought of as an inferior network to their major competitors.
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h1>Solution</h1>
			<hr>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Create light hearted online content pairing a Vodafone 4G ‘hero’ against regular consumers in a WiFi speed test to prove to people that Vodafone is genuinely faster no matter where you are. We made the content funny so people wanted to watch it and then off the back of it, we ran a promotion giving people the chance to win a phone every hour in order to generate leads.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h1>Results</h1>
			<hr>
			With a telemarketing team following up all the leads we generated, and, a planned email marketing campaign reinforcing all the other benefits that switching to Vodafone gave consumers, we managed to convince over 30,000 people to change networks over the course of a 6 month period.
